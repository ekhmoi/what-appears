# Part I Addition
### A note on “awareness”

In this book I mostly avoid splitting experience into “awareness + contents”.

When I say **field**, I already mean:

> the whole experiencing now, from this side –  
> everything that is showing up, as it shows up.

There isn’t a separate hidden observer behind it.

Inside that, what people often call “awareness” can be noticed as a **quality of the field itself**:

- sometimes experience feels bright, vivid, very **here**,
- sometimes it feels foggy, dull, half-absent,
- sometimes it feels wide and open,
- sometimes tight and tunnelled.

Those differences show up **inside** experience, as *how the field is right now*.

From this lens:

- I don’t treat “Awareness” as a second substance behind appearances.
- I treat “awareness” (in the phenomenological sense) as:
  
  > the **lit-up-ness / here-ness / clarity** flavour of the current field.

So:

- **Field** = whatever is present, already as-experienced.
- **Awareness-as-quality** = how lit up / clear / foggy / open this field currently is.

Later on, when I introduce **“awareness-mode”** in the architecture section, that’s not a mystical extra ingredient. It’s a structural term for a kind of world-level process that shows up, from inside, as:

> “me, here, having a world.”



# Part V - Awareness-mode / World level Addition
### Awareness-mode, and how it relates to the field

Earlier I said I mostly avoid talking about “awareness + contents”, and instead talk about the **field** – everything that’s present, as experienced, now.

Inside that, what we could call “awareness” shows up as a **quality of the field**:

- clearer or foggier,
- more or less here,
- more open or more contracted.

That’s the phenomenological side.

Here, when I say **awareness-mode**, I’m not suddenly introducing a ghost-substance called “Awareness”.

I mean:

> a particular way a living system is organised at the world-level,  
> such that there is a structured, lit-up field from this side.

From the inside, awareness-mode feels like:

- “I am here,”
- “there is a world around me,”
- “I can sense, predict, and act.”

From the outside (in world-language), it’s:

- an organism running models, updating, choosing actions, keeping itself going.

So we have:

- **Field** – how this all appears from here, with its current quality (bright/dull, open/closed, etc.).
- **Awareness-as-quality** – the felt lit-up-ness / here-ness of this field.
- **Awareness-mode** – the world-level pattern that corresponds to there being a perspective like this at all.

Still no second metaphysical substance.  
Just one happening, described from two angles: inside (field + qualities) and outside (systems / architecture).


# Update to Protocols:
> (I’m not calling these “awareness protocols” on purpose. The point here isn’t to manipulate some special Awareness-substance, but to change how the system is allowed to tell the story of “me” inside the field that’s already lit up.)
