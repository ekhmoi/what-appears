# Awareness – Working Summary (Internal Note)

## 1. Baseline: Field, Not “Awareness + Contents”

- In the phenomenology part of the book:
  - I use **“field”** to mean:
    > the whole experiencing now, from this node.
  - I **deliberately avoid** splitting this into “awareness + contents”.
- So:
  - No “hidden observer” behind experience.
  - No “awareness” as a separate entity.
  - Just: **whatever is here, as it shows up** = field.

---

## 2. Where the Confusion Started

- Dmytro: “awareness is also appearance.”
- My system glitch:
  - If _field = whole experiencing_,  
    how can “awareness” be **one more thing inside it**?
  - It starts to feel like:
    - either awareness is _outside_ field → dualism (nope), or
    - awareness is just another object → then what’s special about it?

---

## 3. Resolution: Awareness as a _Quality_ of the Field

To keep my structure coherent:

- Don’t treat “awareness” as:
  - an **object** alongside cup, thought, emotion, etc.
- Treat “awareness” as:
  > a **global property / quality** of the current field configuration  
  > (like brightness, clarity, presence, openness).

Examples:

- Sometimes experience feels:
  - dull, foggy, contracted → “less aware”.
  - bright, vivid, open → “more aware”.
- Those differences show up **inside** experience, as _how the field is_.

So:

- **Field** = everything lit up **right now** (content + global feel).
- **“Awareness” (phenomenological sense)** ≈  
  the _lit-up-ness / here-ness / knowing-ness_ flavour of the current field.

No second substance.  
Just: field + its current mode of illumination.

## 4. Two Levels: Phenomenology vs Architecture

### Phenomenology layer (book early parts)

- Only talk about:
  - field,
  - figure/ground,
  - body/world/thought/feeling/pull,
  - hub/stack, etc.
- **Avoid “awareness”** as a technical term.
- Implicit stance:
  > “Field” already means “experienced / aware” – no need to name awareness separately.

### Architecture layer (later parts)

- Introduce **“awareness-mode”** as:
  > a _world-level pattern_:  
  > an organism + its self-maintaining, modelling, point-of-view dynamics.
- Here, awareness-mode is:
  - not a felt ghost,
  - but a **structural role**:  
    “this kind of process in the world that corresponds to ‘being a perspective’.”

So I have:

- **Phenomenological awareness**  
  (not necessarily named in text):  
  → quality of how the field is lit up.
- **Awareness-mode (architectural)**  
  → the world-level configuration that gives rise to that sort of field.

## 5. Naming: Why “Alignment Protocol”, Not “Awareness Protocol”

- We previously called some steps an “awareness protocol”.
- In reality, that protocol is about:
  - **aligning** what appears,
  - with the **story** about it,
  - and the **actions** taken.
- It is **not** about manipulating “awareness” as a substance.

So:

- Rename to **“alignment protocol”**.
- Keep the word **“awareness”** out of protocol names in the phenomenology sections, to avoid:
  - reifying it,
  - confusing readers into thinking there is a separate “awareness thing” they must find.

## 6. Short Paragraph I Might Use in the Book (Draft)

> In this book I mostly avoid the word _awareness_ in the descriptive parts.  
> When I say _field_, I already mean whatever is showing up, as experienced, now.  
> Talking about “awareness + contents” too early tends to create an imaginary ghost observer behind experience. Later, when I introduce “awareness-mode”, that’s not a mystical extra ingredient, but a structural term for a certain kind of world-level process that appears, from inside, as a point of view like “me, here, in this world”.
