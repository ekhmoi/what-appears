### Scratch – how other people appear

So far I’ve mostly talked about “me in my field” – what shows up, how it clumps, how the different me-layers behave.

But most of the actual pain and sweetness of life is about **other people**.

So how do other people appear, in this lens?

#### 1. People-shaped appearances

At the most basic level, other people show up as:

- a body in space (face, voice, smell, movement)
- a certain “vibe” (tense / open / bored / dangerous / safe)
- a cluster of memories and expectations

That whole bundle is a **compression** in my field.  
Let’s call that a **you-model**: how this system currently has “you” clumped.

Different you-models can look like:

- “my boss”
- “my partner”
- “my dad, even when I’m talking to someone who isn’t him”
- “that type of person” (annoying, hot, scary, impressive, etc.)

This is all happening on *my* side of the glass.

#### 2. You-models are guesses about an invisible field

When I look at you, I don’t just see your body. I also *implicitly* imagine:

- that there is an inner field behind your eyes
- that things feel like something from your side
- that you have your own me-stack, your own worries, hopes, shame, stories

I never see that field directly. I get:

- snapshots of your behaviour
- my interpretations of your words
- my projections

From that, my brain builds and constantly updates a you-model:  
guesses about what hurts you, what you want, what you will probably do.

Sometimes the you-model is pretty close.  
Sometimes it’s wildly wrong but feels absolutely obvious.

#### 3. Me-stack and you-models

The existing me-layers all interact with you-models:

- **social-me** cares a lot about how I appear *in your field*  
  (or rather: in my *imagined* version of your field)
- **moral-me** creates stories about what kind of person you are  
  (“good”, “selfish”, “cruel”, “trying their best”)
- **story-me** casts you in roles in my personal narrative  
  (“mentor”, “villain”, “side character”, “audience”)

All of this is happening *inside my field*, but it points at a real person whose own field I can’t fully know.

That gap – between my you-model and you-as-you – is where a lot of relationship pain lives.

#### 4. Why this matters

If I forget that you-models are compressions, I start to treat them as literal:

- “You are exactly this story I have about you.”
- “If I feel you’re judging me, that means you are.”
- “If you fit ‘dad-shaped’ in my nervous system, you must actually be my dad 2.0.”

Then I’m not really with you. I’m with my own compression.

On the other hand, if I pretend it’s *all* “just my appearance” and you’re basically an NPC in my private theatre, I lose something important:

- your reality as a centre of experience
- the basic ethical sense of “there is someone over there I can hurt or help”

This lens can’t give me direct access to your field. That’s just a basic condition of being a mind.

What it can do is:

- make my you-models *visible* as models
- help me notice when I’m relating more to my compression of you than to you
- open some curiosity:
  - “what might it be like from their side right now?”
  - “what am I assuming that might be off?”

That’s enough to already change a lot of how relationships feel from here.
