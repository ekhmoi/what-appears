# Staying Oriented When It Gets Weird

Working directly with experience, self, and story can get… weird.

Especially if you’ve:

- had intense religious or anti-religious phases,
- done psychedelics or deep meditation,
- gone through big identity shifts.

This chapter is a small collection of orientation points — things to keep in mind so the moves in this part stay supportive rather than derailing.

## 1. You are allowed to be ordinary

A lot of nondual/spiritual/phenomenology talk can create a subtle pressure:

- to be special,
- to see through everything,
- to live in some extraordinary state.

You don’t need any of that for this material to be useful.

You’re allowed to:

- care about your job, your friends, your laundry, your next meal,
- be a basically normal human who happens to have an odd lens for experience,
- be more interested in being kind and sane than in being profound.

Stabilising around a simple, ordinary “I” is not a failure.  
Sometimes it’s exactly the right move.

## 2. Don’t use the lens as a weapon against yourself

Because this stuff is subtle and powerful, there’s a risk of:

- “If everything is just appearance/compression, my pain isn’t real.”
- “If there’s no solid self, I shouldn’t care about boundaries.”
- “If I were really seeing clearly, I wouldn’t feel this.”

Those are just **new harsh stories** wearing a clever hat.

If you notice you’re using any idea from this book to:

- invalidate your own experience,
- force yourself to stay in harm’s way,
- shame yourself for being human,

that’s a sign to:

- put the idea down for now,
- re-stabilise in simple, human terms,
- or talk to someone outside the framework.

The lens is here to reduce suffering and confusion, not to provide fancier ways to be cruel to yourself.

## 3. Beware of sudden, total conclusions

Big experiences (psychedelic, religious, romantic, traumatic, meditative) can come with big conclusions:

- “Nothing is real.”
- “Everything is love.”
- “I’ve been living a lie; I must burn everything down.”
- “This is my destiny.”
- “I’ve seen the final truth.”

Sometimes, these carry important insights.  
Sometimes, they’re the field overfitting to one intense configuration.

You don’t have to immediately obey or deny them.

You can treat them as:

- **data points**: “this is one way the field can appear”,
- invitations to **slow testing** over time,
- not final verdicts.

If a conclusion demands that you:

- isolate completely,
- abandon all commitments overnight,
- or hurt yourself or others,

that’s a flag to seek more perspectives and go slower.

## 4. When in doubt, zoom back to very simple checks

If you get lost in abstractions, you can reset with:

- What do I actually see / hear / feel in my body right now?
- Am I hungry, thirsty, exhausted?
- Have I talked to another human honestly today?
- Do I need a walk, a meal, a nap, a hug, a break from thinking?

Basic animal-level stabilisation is not separate from “deep work”.  
It’s part of it.

## 5. Therapy, friends, and other humans are allowed

This might be obvious, but I’ll say it anyway:

- This book is not a replacement for real relationships or professional help.
- Working with experience is not a reason to do everything alone.
- Sometimes the most skillful move is to say “I’m over my head, I need help.”

You can use this lens _and_ use:

- therapy,
- medication,
- community,
- art,
- prayer,
- whatever else helps you.

There’s no purity test.

---

## 6. You can drop the whole lens

Finally:

You are absolutely allowed to:

- close this book,
- never think about “field” or “compression” again,
- and live your life using whatever lenses work better for you.

This whole project is just one attempt by one mind to make sense of its own mess.

If it helps you see your experience more kindly and clearly, keep it.  
If it starts making things worse, treat that as accurate feedback from your system.

You don’t owe this lens anything.

With that, Part III is done:

- We’ve seen what difficult feelings tend to point to,
- two big ways the field can reorganise (stabilise / dissolve),
- and some ways to weave those in real life.

Part IV will pull back and show one coherent **architecture of appearance** that ties all this together — for the part of you that likes seeing the system as a whole.
