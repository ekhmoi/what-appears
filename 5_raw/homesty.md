### Honesty (inside first, outside eventually)

This isn’t a moral lecture about “always tell the truth.”

I care about honesty here because of how it **changes the field**.

If I’m bullshitting myself about what appears, the whole lens collapses.  
If I’m not bullshitting myself, it becomes very hard (over time) to keep bullshitting other people.

#### Inside honesty

When I say “honesty” here, I mean first of all:

- admitting what is actually in the field,
- even if I don’t like it,
- even if I don’t have a fix for it,
- even if it doesn’t match the story I want to tell about myself.

Examples:

- “I’m jealous of my friend” *even though* I want to be the chill, generous one.
- “I want people to like this book” *even though* my spiritual ego wants to be above that.
- “I feel small and scared right now” *even though* my social-me wants to present as fine.

Inside honesty is just:

> letting those appearances register as real,  
> without immediately arguing with them.

This is mostly between me and my own field. Nobody else has to hear it.

#### How inside honesty leaks outwards

Something interesting tends to happen if I keep doing that for a while:

- the gap between **what’s actually here** and **what I show outside** starts to hurt more,
- social-me has to work harder to maintain the performance,
- moral-me starts to notice “oh, I’m lying a bit”, even if it’s “polite” lying.

At some point, continuing to pretend outside starts to feel more expensive than:

> “okay, I’ll just say something closer to the real thing.”

Not because I’ve become a saint.  
Just because the cost of the split gets too high.

So for me, the “protocol” looks something like:

1. **Be honest with myself first.**  
   If I can’t admit it inside, I definitely can’t say it outside.
2. **Let that honesty sit for a while.**  
   No rush to confess to the world. Just feel what it’s like to know.
3. **Notice where the split hurts.**  
   Pay attention to situations where I’m playing a role that’s far from what I actually see/feel.
4. **Experiment with small outer honesty.**  
   Say one notch more real in low-stakes places. See what actually happens.

Over time, this usually drifts me toward being more honest **with other people**, almost as a side-effect:

- I’m less able to sell them a version of me I don’t believe in,
- I’m less interested in relationships that require ongoing pretending,
- I’m more okay with “this is where I’m really at”, even if it’s not flattering.

#### Not a commandment, more an invitation

I’m not saying you “must” live like this.

Sometimes it’s not safe to be fully honest with the outside world.  
Sometimes there are real power dynamics, cultures, or laws that make outer honesty dangerous.

What I’m pointing at is:

- **inner** honesty as a basic protocol for using this lens at all,
- and the way that, if you follow that long enough, it *tugs* you toward more outer honesty wherever it’s even a little bit safe to do that.

If you let yourself really know:

> “this is what I want,”  
> “this is what I’m ashamed of,”  
> “this is what hurts,”  
> “this is what I believe,”

then inviting the outside world to meet that—bit by bit, with care—often becomes the next natural move.

You don’t have to jump straight to radical transparency.  
You can just start with:

> “Can I be 10% more honest here than I usually would?”

and see what kind of life starts to appear around that.
