### Protocols for using this lens

This isn’t a religion and these aren’t commandments.

These are just the house rules that keep this lens from turning into another way to lie to myself or beat myself up. You don’t have to adopt them. They’re here as options.

---

## 1. Honesty (inside first, outside eventually)

This is not a moral lecture about “always tell the truth.”

I care about honesty here because of how it **changes the field**.

If I’m bullshitting myself about what appears, the whole lens collapses.  
If I’m not bullshitting myself, it becomes very hard (over time) to keep bullshitting other people.

### Inside honesty

When I say “honesty” here, I mean first of all:

- admitting what is actually in the field,
- even if I don’t like it,
- even if I don’t have a fix for it,
- even if it doesn’t match the story I want to tell about myself.

Examples:

- “I’m jealous of my friend” _even though_ I want to be the chill, generous one.
- “I want people to like this book” _even though_ my spiritual ego wants to be above that.
- “I feel small and scared right now” _even though_ my social-me wants to present as fine.

Inside honesty is just:

> letting those appearances register as real,  
> without immediately arguing with them.

This is mostly between me and my own field. Nobody else has to hear it.

### How inside honesty leaks outwards

If I keep doing that for a while, something tends to happen:

- the gap between **what’s actually here** and **what I show outside** starts to hurt more,
- social-me has to work harder to maintain the performance,
- moral-me starts to notice “oh, I’m lying a bit”, even if it’s “polite” lying.

At some point, continuing to pretend outside starts to feel more expensive than:

> “okay, I’ll just say something closer to the real thing.”

Not because I’ve become a saint.  
Just because the cost of the split gets too high.

For me, the “protocol” looks like:

1. **Be honest with myself first.**  
   If I can’t admit it inside, I definitely can’t say it outside.
2. **Let that honesty sit for a while.**  
   No rush to confess to the world. Just feel what it’s like to know.
3. **Notice where the split hurts.**  
   Pay attention to situations where I’m playing a role that’s far from what I actually see/feel.
4. **Experiment with small outer honesty.**  
   Say one notch more real in low-stakes places. See what actually happens.

Over time, this usually drifts me toward being more honest **with other people**, almost as a side-effect:

- I’m less able to sell them a version of me I don’t believe in.
- I’m less interested in relationships that require ongoing pretending.
- I’m more okay with “this is where I’m really at,” even if it’s not flattering.

### When honesty is _not_ a good idea

There are situations where outer honesty is actually unsafe or unwise:

- abusive relationships and families
- workplaces or states that punish dissent
- cultures where being open about sexuality, belief, etc. can get you harmed
- legal situations where you genuinely need a lawyer, not “radical openness”

In those cases:

- **inner** honesty still matters (at least you know what’s true for you),
- but **outer** honesty may need to be carefully rationed or delayed.

“Being honest” does not mean:

- telling everything to everyone,
- giving people ammo to hurt you,
- ignoring power dynamics.

Sometimes the honest move is:

> “I know what’s true for me here,  
> and I’m _not_ going to share it with this person / in this system,  
> because it’s not safe enough yet.”

That’s not cowardice. That’s system-me doing threat modelling.

## 2. Humility (this is _a_ lens, not _the_ lens)

This lens has been very helpful for me. It is not a final theory of reality.

Humility here just means:

- remembering this is **a tool**, not a rank,
- not needing other people to use it for their lives to be valid,
- letting other maps exist without feeling attacked.

Concretely, that looks like:

- If someone is helped more by therapy, religion, medication, another framework, I don’t see that as a threat to this one.
- I try not to use these concepts as a way to feel secretly above other people (“I understand your field, you don’t understand mine”).
- If someone says “this doesn’t land for me,” I treat that as information, not a sin.

Humility here is mostly an anti-bullshit move:

> don’t quietly upgrade “a lens that helps me”  
> into “The Way Things Really Are” and then forget I did that.

## 3. Gentleness (especially with shame)

If “looking at what appears” turns into “finding new reasons I’m failing,” I’m off track.

Gentleness as a protocol means:

- If I notice shame, I assume something in me is trying (and maybe failing) to protect something it cares about.
- I don’t force myself to stare at things when the inner resourcing isn’t there yet.
- I treat parts of me like scared animals, not defective machines.

This is not about being morally “nice.”  
It’s just practical:

> systems under attack don’t re-organise well.

If using this lens makes your inner field feel like a courtroom, you have my full permission to throw the book across the room and eat something instead.

---

## 4. Permission to drop the lens

This one is simple:

- If this lens stops helping in a situation, I’m allowed to put it down.
- I don’t have to explain every moment of my life in these terms.
- Sometimes the most skillful move is to call a friend, cry, sleep, eat, watch dumb videos, or go to therapy.

In other words:

> you don’t owe this book anything.

You can:

- use it for one problem and never touch it again,
- steal 2–3 ideas and ignore the rest,
- come back to it in a year,
- or decide “nah, not for me” and toss it.

The lens works best when it’s used in the spirit it points to:

- less self-deception,
- more room,
- less violence inside the field.

Everything here is an invitation, not a law.
