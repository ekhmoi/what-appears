## Weaving Responses and Staying Oriented

We now have two big moves on the table:

- **Stabilise** – firm up “I”, values, boundaries, next steps.
- **Dissolve** – loosen rigid clumps and splits, widen the field.

This chapter is about:

- how to sense which move is needed when,
- how they can support each other,
- where the edge-cases and traps tend to be.

### A crude but useful rule of thumb

This is oversimplified, but helpful:

- When things feel **too loose**, disorienting, unreal, ungrounded →  
  lean more on **stabilising**.

- When things feel **too tight**, claustrophobic, rigid, no-way-out →  
  lean more on **dissolving**.

You can check this in your own experience:

- If you’re spinning in abstractness, identity confusion, or derealisation,  
  dissolving further usually makes it worse. Stabilising helps.

- If you’re locked into “I am this one terrible thing and this situation proves it”,  
  doubling down on that identity usually makes it worse. Some dissolving helps.

### Typical sequences

In many real situations, you’ll do a **sequence**, not a pure move.

#### Sequence A: stabilise → then dissolve

Useful when you’re fragile, overwhelmed, or close to the edge.

Rough flow:

1. **Stabilise the base**

   - ground in body, place, simple routines,
   - clarify a minimal “I” and a few concrete commitments.

2. **Once there’s some safety, gently dissolve**
   - question harsh identities,
   - de-clump stories,
   - explore wider perspectives.

Example:

- You’re in a rough depressive/numb patch.
- First, you stabilise:

  - regular meals, sleep, a few people you trust,
  - “I am someone who is going through something hard and still doing small things.”

- Only later do you start dissolving:
  - “maybe the story ‘I am fundamentally broken’ is a very old compression, not the final truth.”

#### Sequence B: dissolve → then stabilise

Useful when you’re stuck in a very narrow, self-attacking frame.

Rough flow:

1. **Dissolve the tightest knot a little**

   - see the story as a story,
   - widen out to the rest of the field,
   - see other contributing factors.

2. **Then re-stabilise in a less cruel way**
   - choose a kinder working self-description,
   - make concrete moves from there.

Example:

- You’re locked in “I ruined everything with that one mistake.”
- First, you dissolve:

  - notice other moments in the relationship,
  - other people’s agency,
  - the fact that this is one event among thousands.

- Then you stabilise:
  - “I’m someone who did something that hurt, cares about that, and is willing to repair as best I can.”

### Listening for which move is needed

Some quick self-questions:

- **Does my system feel more flooded or more frozen?**

  - Flooded → might need stabilising (containment, orientation).
  - Frozen → might need dissolving (space, options).

- **Is the current problem “too much chaos” or “too much rigidity”?**

  - Too much chaos → stabilise.
  - Too much rigidity → dissolve.

- **If I gently imagine dissolving this identity/story, do I feel relief or terror?**

  - If it’s sheer terror, maybe stabilise first.
  - If there’s some relief, maybe dissolving is ready to lead.

- **If I gently imagine taking a clearer stand or boundary, do I feel relief or suffocation?**
  - If relief, stabilising might be primary.
  - If suffocation, maybe something else in the frame needs to loosen first.

You don’t have to get this “right”.  
The moves are experiments. The field will give you feedback.

### Common failure modes

A few patterns I’ve seen in myself and others:

#### 1. All dissolve, no stabilise

- “It’s all stories, man.”
- “There is no self, so none of this really matters.”
- “Everything is empty appearances.”

This can temporarily feel spacious.  
But if it ignores:

- your actual needs,
- your values,
- your relationships,
- your nervous system,

it often leads to:

- drift,
- spiritual bypass,
- or quiet despair.

The medicine:

- deliberately **re-entering form**:
  - caring about specific people,
  - making concrete promises,
  - letting yourself want things.

#### 2. All stabilise, no dissolve

- “This is just who I am, full stop.”
- “This is how the world works, everyone else is wrong.”
- “These are my values, they never change.”

Sometimes that’s courage.  
Sometimes it’s fear of change dressed up as integrity.

Without any dissolving, you can get:

- brittle identities,
- chronic conflict with reality,
- no way to grow.

The medicine:

- small, low-stakes experiments in loosening:
  - “What if I’m only mostly like this?”
  - “What if there’s one exception to this story?”
  - “What if this other person’s perspective contains 5% I missed?”

#### 3. Using one move to attack the other

- Using dissolving to attack stabilising:

  - “Your boundaries are just ego. Your pain is just a story. Let go more.”

- Using stabilising to attack dissolving:
  - “If you see things as a field, you’ll become irresponsible / detached / crazy.”

Both moves are trying to protect something important.  
The point is not to pick a side, but to have **both available**.

### Your own style of weaving

Different people and different histories will bias you:

- Some will naturally stabilise first, dissolve rarely.
- Others will dissolve everything and forget to stabilise.

It can help to know your bias:

- “I tend to over-stabilise, so I might experiment with tiny dissolves.”
- “I tend to over-dissolve, so I might experiment with more straightforward commitments.”

Over time, you can develop a feel for:

- what a healthy “baseline” mix feels like for you,
- when you’re swinging too far to one side.

The next chapter will ground this in **concrete mini-walkthroughs**, so this doesn’t stay abstract.
