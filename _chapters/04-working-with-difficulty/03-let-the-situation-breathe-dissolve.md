## Move Two – Letting the Situation Breathe (Dissolve)

If Move One is about **tightening** around a trustworthy “I” and clearer boundaries,

Move Two is about:

> **loosening** overly tight clumps and splits,  
> so the situation has more room to move.

You already do this too, in small ways:

- laughing at yourself and relaxing,
- seeing a fight from the other person’s side,
- zooming out and realising “this isn’t my whole life”,
- touching moments where the usual “me” drama quiets down.

Here we’ll look at this move more deliberately.

### Why dissolving helps

Sometimes the problem is not:

- “I don’t know who I am here,”

but:

- “I am gripping a particular identity or story so hard  
  that the field has no space to reorganise.”

Examples:

- “I must be the one who fixes everything.”
- “I must never hurt anyone.”
- “I am permanently broken.”
- “They are just evil.”
- “This situation defines my whole life.”

These are extreme **compressions**:

- vast complexity → one rigid clump.

Dissolving, in this sense, means:

- softening those compressions,
- seeing more of the raw field again,
- letting inside/outside, self/other, past/future become a bit less absolute.

Not as a metaphysical claim, but as a way to give more **degrees of freedom**.

### Ways the field can soften

Here are a few kinds of loosening, all within experience:

#### 1. De-clumping

Instead of “my whole life is a mess”, you gently unpack:

- this job situation,
- this relationship,
- this health thing,
- this internal pattern.

The field shifts from:

- one huge, black “mess” clump

to:

- several more specific, more workable pieces.

Subjectively, that can feel like:

- more **breathing room**,
- less sense of total doom.

#### 2. De-centering “me”

Instead of:

- “this is _about me_ being fundamentally bad / good / doomed”,

you can explore:

- “what if this is a pattern playing out between many factors in the field?”

For example:

- instead of “I am unlovable, that’s why relationships go like this”,  
  you might start to see:

  - attachment patterns,
  - the other person’s history,
  - cultural scripts,
  - timing,
  - all contributing.

You’re not erasing yourself.  
You’re seeing **“me” as one process among others**, not the sole cursed centre of everything.

#### 3. Softening inside/outside

Sometimes the field is split into:

- “in here, the real suffering”,
- “out there, a fixed hostile or indifferent world.”

Softening that can look like:

- noticing how “the world” appears as stories, images, headlines in your field,
- seeing that even other people’s reactions are also **appearances** you interpret,
- realising that some of the harshest voices come from internalised others, not current reality.

Again, you’re not denying that a world exists.  
You’re recognising that:

- some of the hardest edges are partly being maintained by inner structure.

#### 4. Glimpses of non-dual-ish clarity

Sometimes, especially for people who’ve had psychedelic or contemplative openings, dissolving can go further:

- the sense of a separate “subject in here” vs “objects out there” relaxes,
- experience is more like one continuous field of happening,
- “me” is seen more as a local pattern than a solid core.

When this is accessible _and_ the system is stable enough, it can be:

- profoundly relieving,
- a way for problems to be held in a much wider context,
- less claustrophobic.

But it can also be disorienting or destabilising if used at the wrong time or in the wrong way. More on that in a bit.

### How dissolving feels

When dissolving is helpful, you might notice:

- less tightness around “I”,
- more sense that multiple things can be true,
- more sense that this situation is part of a larger life,
- sometimes a sense of “this is all happening in a bigger space than I thought.”

The content of problems may not change right away.  
But their **grip** does.

The field shifts from:

- one rigid foreground object that eats everything,

to:

- a more open sense of many things coexisting,
- with more possible ways to relate.

### A gentle dissolving script

Again, not a ritual, just a sketch of a move.

When you notice you’re gripped by a harsh story or identity:

1. **Name the clump**

   - “Right now the field is organised as:  
     _I am someone who X, and this proves it._”

2. **Widen the frame a bit**

   - “What else is in my field **right now**, besides this story?”
   - sights, sounds, body, other concerns, small neutral details.

3. **De-clump small pieces**

   - “What different threads are actually being glued into this big blob?”
     - this event,
     - older memories,
     - someone’s voice in my head,
     - specific bodily sensations.

4. **Question absolutes lightly**

   - “Is it literally true that this moment defines my entire life?”
   - “Are there any counterexamples, however small?”
   - “If a friend were in exactly this situation, would I see them only through this one label?”

5. **If it feels safe, touch a bit of de-centering**

   - “For a moment, what if this isn’t _about me_ as a defect,  
      but about a pattern happening in this human life, with many inputs?”

You’re not forcing yourself to believe a new positive story.  
You’re just letting the current compression loosen enough that:

- other information can enter,
- other moves can become visible.

### When dissolving goes wrong

Dissolving can be misused too. Common ways:

- **Spiritual bypass**

  - using “it’s all one” or “there is no self” to avoid concrete problems,
  - skipping necessary boundaries or grief.

- **Self-gaslighting**

  - telling yourself “it’s just a story” when in fact something real and harmful is happening,
  - flattening your own values and preferences.

- **Destabilisation**
  - pushing too hard into de-centering when the system is already fragile,
  - triggering derealisation / depersonalisation (“none of this is real / I’m not real”).

When that happens, the field can feel:

- unreal,
- ungrounded,
- meaningless,
- or weirdly hollow.

That’s often a sign that what’s needed is:

- more **stabilising** – more body, more simple “I”, more ordinary life,
- less aggressive dissolving.

### Two moves, not two religions

The main thing I want to avoid is:

- a “stabilise camp” and a “dissolve camp”,
- each treating the other as wrong.

Both moves are part of how human experience already works.

Roughly:

- stabilising = **tightening around form** where there was not enough of it,
- dissolving = **softening form** where it has become too rigid or too small.

In practice, most situations need some of each, in some order.

The next chapter is about the **weaving**:  
how to feel into which move to lean on more, when.
