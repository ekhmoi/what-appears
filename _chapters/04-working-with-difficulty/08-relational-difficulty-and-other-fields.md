## DRAFT - Other Fields: People, Animals, and Relational Difficulty

In Part I we noticed that:

- other people and animals already appear in the field,
- not just as objects, but often as **centres** you relate to.

From your side, they show up as:

- bodies, faces, voices, messages, traces,
- plus an intuition of “someone there” — another inside, another “me”.

Now, in Part III, we’re looking at **difficulty** and **moves**.

A lot of the hardest configurations don’t happen in isolation. They happen:

- between your field and **other fields** —  
  other centres with their own self/world/time/story stacks.

This chapter is about:

> how to hold other humans (and, a bit, animals) in this lens  
> when things are painful, confusing, or intense.

### Remembering: from my field, others are patterns _and_ centres

From _here_, others still appear as patterns in **your** field:

- their face,
- their tone,
- your memories of them,
- your predictions about their reactions.

You never see their field directly.

But unless you’ve shut it down, your system also treats them as **centres**:

- you imagine their feelings,
- you care about (or fear) how they experience you,
- you feel it when they turn toward or away from you.

So there are two truths at once:

1. Other people appear as **patterns in your field**.
2. You can choose to relate to them **as if** they are also centres with their own field.

This “as if” is not fake. It’s:

- a stance,
- a protocol for how you hold others,
- and it has big consequences for how difficulty unfolds.

### The ego temptation: turning others into props

Under certain ego-generating protocols (from the previous chapter):

- “protect my image at any cost”,
- “never show weakness”,
- “I’m the one who sees reality correctly”,

it becomes very tempting to treat others as **props**:

- NPCs in your world,
- background objects that either validate or threaten your story.

It sounds like:

- “They’re just running their pattern.”
- “These are my projections.”
- “They’re part of my field.”

There’s some truth there:

- you _do_ project a lot,
- they _do_ show up as appearances in your field.

But if you stop there, it feeds certain ego-stories:

- “I’m the only real centre here.”
- “I’m above these unconscious people.”
- “Their experience doesn’t matter; only my process does.”

That usually leads to:

- brittle relationships,
- contempt,
- or quiet loneliness.

### A different protocol: centre-to-centre

You can adopt a different protocol, something like:

> “From my side, you appear as patterns in my field.  
> And I’m going to act as if you are also a centre,  
> with your own field, your own difficulty, your own moves.”

That doesn’t require metaphysical certainty.  
It’s more like a bet:

- this stance matches my own experience of being a centre,
- it matches how love, empathy, and grief already operate,
- it keeps me from collapsing entirely into self-obsession.

Under this protocol, when difficulty arises, you might ask:

- “What does this look like from _their_ field?”
- “If they are another centre, what might be hurting or threatened there?”
- “Is my current ‘me-story’ making them into a caricature?”

You still hold your own boundaries (we’ll get to that).  
You just stop treating others as scenery.

### Seeing others’ difficulty and moves

Once you see others as centres, you can start to recognise:

- **their** anxiety, shame, anger, numbness
- as _their_ field trying to stabilise/dissolve under pressure.

Examples:

- Someone snapping at you:

  - might be a desperate attempt to stabilise a fragile “I who is not wrong”,
  - not proof that you are worthless trash.

- Someone going cold and distant:

  - might be numbness / overload in _their_ system,
  - not necessarily a verdict on your worth.

- Someone clinging rigidly to a view:
  - might be terror of dissolving more identity than they can handle,
  - not simply “they’re stupid.”

None of this excuses harmful behaviour.  
It just gives you a more nuanced frame than:

- “they’re evil / they’re perfect / they’re my mirror / they’re my enemy.”

You get to hold:

- “this behaviour is not okay for my field”,
- **and** “they are also a centre trying to cope with something.”

### Honesty and humility in relationship

The protocols from the previous chapter apply here too.

#### Inner honesty in relationship

Inner honesty might sound like:

- “In my field, this dynamic feels like X.”
- “I say I don’t care what they think, but my body responds every time.”
- “I’m telling myself they’re the only problem, but there’s also something I’m avoiding.”

You’re not required to share all of this.  
But admitting it to yourself changes how you hold the other.

It reduces:

- pure blame,
- pure self-blame,
- fantasy versions of them.

#### Humility in relationship

Humility might sound like:

- “This is my read on them; it’s based on limited data.”
- “My story about their motives is a compression, not their entire field.”
- “I might be the villain in _their_ narrative right now.”

Again, this doesn’t mean “I’m always wrong” or “everyone is secretly kind”.  
It just keeps room for:

- “I might be missing something important.”

That can de-escalate certain spirals long before any formal technique.

### Boundaries: caring about both fields

Recognising others as centres doesn’t mean:

- letting them do whatever,
- absorbing all the impact of their difficulty,
- erasing your own field.

In this lens, **boundaries** are:

> ways of saying  
> “this is how close our fields can safely come  
> given both of our current configurations.”

Sometimes that looks like:

- “I care about you, and I can’t stay in daily contact right now.”
- “I believe you’re suffering, and I won’t be spoken to like this.”
- “I see your side, and this still doesn’t work for me.”

Healthy boundaries care about **both**:

- your field’s limits,
- and the fact that the other is a centre, not an object.

They’re often messy and imperfect. That’s fine.

### Animals and other non-human centres

Briefly on animals:

- If you relate to a particular animal as a centre,
- you’re already running a “other field over there” model.

In difficulty, that may show up as:

- guilt or grief around how they’re treated,
- confusion about what your responsibility is,
- tenderness mixed with fear of loss.

You don’t need a grand theory of animal consciousness to work with this.

You can just notice:

- “In my field, this creature is not furniture.”
- “My actions affect a centre that can suffer.”
- “That matters to me.”

And then bring the same protocols:

- honesty about what you’re actually doing,
- humility about what you don’t understand,
- alignment where you can change your behaviour.

---

### Why this matters for working with difficulty

Most of the big feelings we care about:

- shame,
- jealousy,
- rage,
- heartbreak,
- loneliness,
- devotion,

live at the interface of:

- **your** field,
- and **other** fields.

If you treat others as props, difficulty tends to polarise into:

- “it’s all my fault”  
  or
- “it’s all their fault”.

If you hold others as centres:

- your stabilising moves start to include honest boundaries and care,
- your dissolving moves start to include seeing beyond caricatures,
- your ego-story has to grow up a bit, because it’s not the only story in town.

You don’t have to get this perfect.

It’s enough to occasionally remember:

> “I am one field among many.  
> The way I stabilise and dissolve here  
> touches other centres, not just my private narrative.”

That memory alone can change the flavour of the next hard conversation.
