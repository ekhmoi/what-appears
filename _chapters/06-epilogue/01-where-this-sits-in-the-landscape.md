## Where This Sits in the Landscape

If you’ve read other frameworks — religious, spiritual, psychological, scientific — parts of this book probably lit up old patterns.

This chapter is just a quick “coordinates in concept-space” so you don’t have to guess what this is trying to be.

---

### Not a new religion

This is _not_:

- a revelation from beyond,
- a final word about reality,
- a new thing you have to believe to be okay.

There is no:

- creed,
- membership,
- set of practices you must do,
- special saved group.

What it _is_ trying to be:

- a set of **lenses** for looking at experience,
- that you can pick up and put down as needed,
- that should be judged by:
  - “Does this help me see more clearly?”
  - “Does this reduce unnecessary suffering?”
  - “Does this make me more honest and kind, or less?”

If the answer is “no”, you’re not wrong. The lens just isn’t for you right now.

### Not a complete scientific theory

This is also _not_:

- a neuroscientific model,
- a formal theory in physics or cognitive science,
- a rival to anyone doing actual lab work.

The language of “field” and “compression” _sounds_ a bit like physics or predictive processing. That’s on purpose, but this book is:

- written from inside **first-person experience**,
- using “field” and “compression” as **bridge words**:
  - precise enough to be useful,
  - loose enough not to pretend we have all the math.

If you want a full account of brains, neurons, generative models, etc., you should go read people who specialise in that. This lens is meant to be:

- compatible with several possible scientific pictures,
- not leaning too hard on any one of them.

### Not a school of therapy (but not anti-therapy)

This is _not_ a replacement for:

- psychotherapy,
- trauma work,
- meds,
- support groups.

It overlaps with some therapeutic ideas:

- mapping patterns instead of just symptoms,
- seeing feelings as signals rather than enemies,
- updating self-stories and boundary patterns,
- paying attention to the body and the present field.

If you’re already in therapy, this lens might give you:

- extra language for what you and your therapist are doing,
- a way to notice “oh, we’re doing stabilising here” or “we’re doing dissolving here”.

If you’re not, nothing here should be taken as:

- “you can fix yourself alone now.”

You’re allowed professional help. You’re allowed other humans.

### Overlaps with contemplative and nondual traditions

You might have noticed resonances with:

- mindfulness / vipassanā / insight practice,
- nondual teachings (“no separate self”, “only this”),
- bits of Sufism, Advaita, Dzogchen, etc.

That’s not an accident. Those traditions have been poking at “what appears” and the self/world split for a long time.

This book:

- borrows some of the _moves_ (looking closely at experience, watching clumps form and dissolve, softening subject/object hardness),
- drops a lot of the mythic scaffolding,
- adds more explicit talk about:
  - modern identity,
  - queerness,
  - tech/rationalist mindsets,
  - psychedelics as hacky shortcuts.

If you know those traditions, you can probably map:

- stabilise/dissolve ↔ certain meditation practices,
- nondual clarity ↔ “seeing through” hard self/world splits.

I’m not claiming equivalence or “secret true meaning”. Just saying: there’s family resemblance.

### Overlaps with rationalist / engineering minds

You might also notice the fingerprints of:

- debugging and refactoring,
- architecture diagrams,
- wanting models that actually **compile**.

That’s because the mind that wrote this is:

- a software engineering / architecture mind,
- raised inside strict religious structure,
- then pushed into rebellion and atheism,
- then through psychedelic shortcuts and spirituality,
- then into “fine, I’ll just write my own lens.”

If you come from:

- rationalist / tech / analytic backgrounds,

this book is partly written as:

> “Here is a way to take weird spiritual and phenomenological territory seriously,  
> without having to pretend you don’t care about coherence and architecture.”

If you _don’t_ come from that world, you can mostly ignore this and just treat the diagrams as “some guy’s favourite way to explain things”.

---

### Overlaps with queerness and leaving rigid frames

There’s also a quieter overlap with:

- being queer in a frame that doesn’t allow it,
- leaving a strict religious context,
- rebuilding a sense of self from scratch.

That shows up in:

- sensitivity to shame, exile, and identity fractures,
- refusal to hand you any new “one right way to be”,
- insistence on lenses being **drop-able**.

If you’ve never had to blow up a rigid identity structure, you can still use this book.

If you _have_, you might recognise some of the background pressure that shaped it:

- needing a way to see experience that isn’t:
  - “old religion but secretly”,
  - “pure cold materialism”,
  - or “vague everything-is-love that doesn’t survive contact with real pain.”

This lens wants to sit in the middle of all that and say:

> “We can be precise _and_ tender,  
> weird _and_ sane,  
> finite _and_ not entirely trapped.”

---

You don’t have to care about any of these overlaps to use the lens.

But if you’ve been quietly trying to locate it on your internal map —  
this is roughly where it lives.
