## DRAFT: How This Book Happened (LSD, People, AI)

A small honesty note about how this thing was made.

From one angle, this book came out of:

- growing up inside a strict religious frame,
- leaving that frame and crashing into a flat, rationalist one,
- queerness, shame, and “how do I exist at all now?”,
- years of ordinary, sober noticing of what appears when I’m in pain.

That’s the slow, boring timeline.

There’s also a very specific ingredient I don’t want to pretend wasn’t there:

- several journeys with LSD (and a few with mushrooms).

For **me**, LSD was like a very strong **compression shuffler**:

- it loosened the usual clumping of “me”, “world”, “time”,
- it made certain patterns in the field show up in high contrast,
- it let some old structures fall apart just long enough to see how they were built.

From this book’s point of view, LSD is one more **condition** that changed what could appear:

> not a sacrament, not a requirement,  
> just another way the field got rearranged so different patterns became visible.

This is not an advertisement.
Psychedelics are powerful, unpredictable, and for many people unsafe or illegal.  
Nothing in this book requires you to take them.  
I’m simply naming what actually happened here.

### People as co-authors (whether they like it or not)

Another crucial ingredient is: **people**.

None of this came out of me sitting alone being Deep.

A lot of the patterns in this book were hammered out in:

- late-night calls with close friends,
- conversations where we said the weird thing out loud and nobody flinched,
- trading life stories with people who’d also had their maps ripped apart,
- being around minds honest enough to say “I don’t know,” “this hurts,” “this is fucked,” without spinning it.

I’m not naming anyone here on purpose.

If you’re reading this and you see bits of your phrasing, your questions, your way of seeing tucked into these pages:

> that _is_ you, or at least a version of you,  
> compressed here as a contribution.

Your stories and metaphors and arguments are part of this architecture.  
They’re just blended in now.

### AI as a pattern amplifier

From another angle, this book also wouldn’t exist in this form without **AI models**.

Roughly what happened was:

- I wrote messy notes about:
  - “what appears”,
  - “architecture”,
  - “practical moves” (stabilise / dissolve).
- I fed pieces of that into chatbots.
- I asked them to:
  - expand,
  - reorganise,
  - argue,
  - simplify.
- I kept whatever felt true in my bones and threw away the generic wisdom-slop.

If LSD was a way of shaking the **perceptual** compressions,  
AI was a way of shaking the **linguistic** and **structural** ones:

- remixing sentences,
- offering alternative framings,
- generating examples I could accept, tweak, or reject.

In 2025, this is just part of the reality of thinking and writing:

> minds, molecules, and models  
> all acting as different kinds of pattern amplifiers.

### So who wrote this?

From this lens, the answer is something like:

- The **architecture** – field, compression, me-stack, feelings-as-signals, stabilise/dissolve – came out of this particular life:

  - religion,
  - queerness,
  - anxiety,
  - altered states,
  - and a slightly obsessive systems-brain,
    in conversation with other humans.

- The **language** and **organisation** were co-written with large language models:

  - they generated drafts,
  - I steered, cut, corrected, and said “no, that’s not it” a lot.

- Psychedelics shook the snow-globe enough times that new patterns of seeing had a chance to form at all.

- Friends, lovers, internet strangers, and a few very honest minds provided half the questions and a lot of the courage.

If anything here is coherent or helpful, it’s because those different compressions happened to line up in a useful way.  
If anything here is confused or harmful, that’s on me.

You don’t need to replicate any of this origin story.  
You don’t need LSD, AI, or a matching biography or friend-group for the lens to be useful.

You can just treat this book as:

> one person, standing in 2025,  
> using some of the best and weirdest human compressions available  
> (religion, science, therapy, psychedelics, software, AI, and good people),  
> and trying to glue them into one semi-sane way of talking about what appears.
