## DRAFT - Love, Care, and Attachment in the Field

So far in Part II we’ve mostly walked through difficult states:

- anxiety,
- shame,
- anger,
- numbness.

That’s deliberate: those are the ones that usually drive people to look under the hood.

But the field is also full of **love**, **tenderness**, **care**, **devotion**, **attraction**, **warmth** — and it would be a distortion to treat those as optional extras instead of core dynamics.

This chapter is not a full theory of love. It’s just:

> a way of noticing how love and care appear in the same field,  
> using the same ingredients:  
> field, structure, clumps, self, time, story.

### Love as a way the field organises around “what matters”

Start simple.

Bring to mind someone or something you genuinely care about:

- a person,
- an animal,
- a place,
- a project,
- a community.

Let it into the field and notice:

- **Body**

  - warmth somewhere,
  - softening around the chest or face,
  - a wanting-to-move-towards sensation.

- **Attention**

  - easier to stay with them than with random neutral objects,
  - details feel pleasant or meaningful rather than boring.

- **Thoughts**

  - little flashes of memory,
  - imagined futures with them,
  - micro-worries about their well-being.

- **Pull**
  - be closer,
  - protect,
  - share,
  - show yourself more fully.

Already we can see:

> love is not one floating “feeling”.  
> It’s a **configuration**:  
> specific body textures + attention patterns + stories + pulls,  
> all organised around something the field is treating as **deeply significant**.

### Attachment: love plus dependency and history

When love sits on top of long history and dependency, we usually call it **attachment**:

- you grew up with someone,
- you rely on them,
- your sense of “who I am” is entangled with them.

In the field, that adds:

- **Time**

  - many past scenes compressed into “this person”,
  - many imagined futures that include or exclude them.

- **Self-story**

  - “I am someone who is loved / unloved / chosen / abandoned”,
  - “I am their X (partner, child, parent, friend).”

- **Threat**
  - risk of loss or rejection becomes very salient,
  - anxiety and shame get more intense around them.

So love + attachment is often:

- some of the **sweetest** configurations, and
- some of the **most painful** when things go wrong.

Same lens, same field. Just more layers.

### Tenderness and vulnerability

Another angle:

Moments of **tenderness** often involve:

- the boundary around “me” becoming _slightly_ more permeable,
- letting more of the other field into yours,
- letting more of your own field be visible.

That can feel like:

- being seen in your mess and not attacked,
- seeing someone else’s pain or beauty and wanting them to be okay,
- dropping a layer of performance.

In terms of structure:

- the self-clump softens,
- the other-person clump gains more detail and depth,
- the hard in-here / out-there wall is a bit less absolute.

This can be terrifying for systems that learned:

- “if I am seen, I will be attacked or abandoned”,
- or “if I care, I will be used.”

That’s why love and tenderness so often sit right next to:

- fear,
- shame,
- anger,
- numbness.

They’re pressing on the same **organisation**:  
how safe it is to be visible and to let others matter.

### Erotic pull

We don’t need to write a sex manual here, but it’s worth noting:

> erotic feeling is also a **field configuration**.

It often includes:

- strong **pull** to merge / touch / be seen,
- heightened **salience** of the other’s body and signals,
- mixes of:
  - tenderness,
  - play,
  - power,
  - shame,
  - fear.

For many people (especially queer people in hostile frames), erotic love is where:

- world-level maps (“this is not allowed”) collide with
- field-level truth (“this is intensely alive and real for me”).

That collision can:

- produce massive extra suffering (self-hatred, secrecy, double-life compressions),
- or, when worked through, become one of the engines that forces:
  - more honesty,
  - more realistic self-stories,
  - more contact with what actually appears.

Again: same architecture, just loaded territory.

### Love and the “me”-stack

In terms of the self layers:

- **body-me**

  - touch, proximity, shared physical space.

- **social-me**

  - roles: friend, partner, sibling, caregiver, community member.

- **story-me**

  - “I am someone who loves / is loved / fails at love / can’t be loved.”

- **moral-me**

  - questions of loyalty, betrayal, promise, care.

- **system-me**
  - “I am responsible for these people / creatures”,
  - “I am allowed to have needs, too.”

Love in this frame is:

> a way the field organises self and other  
> so that **their well-being and presence matter intrinsically** to your system.

Not as a moral rule, but as a lived fact.

### Why talk about this in a “difficulty” book?

Two reasons.

1. A lot of difficult feeling is actually about **love**:

   - the threat of losing it,
   - the impossibility of living it,
   - the pain of it having been distorted or weaponised,
   - the hunger for it.

   Leaving love out would make the rest of the map feel weirdly bloodless.

2. Love is also a kind of **stabilisation** and **dissolving**:

   - it can **stabilise** you:

     - “even in this mess, I care about you / this”,
     - “even in this mess, I am cared for.”

   - it can **dissolve** tight self-clumps:
     - “I am not only this isolated problem;  
        I am part of a web of caring and being cared for.”

We’ll touch this again later when we talk about protocols and other fields.

For now, it’s enough to notice:

> love and care are not decorations on top of the field.  
> They are some of the main ways the field organises meaning.
