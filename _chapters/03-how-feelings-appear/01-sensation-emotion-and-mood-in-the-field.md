## Sensation, Emotion, and Mood in the Field

Let’s go back to the **field** from Part I:

- sights, sounds, body sensations, thoughts, memories, expectations, all at once.

Feelings aren’t something added on top of that.  
They’re **part of the field**.

Here we’ll separate three layers, not as a theory of the brain, but as a way of noticing:

- **sensation** – local physical feel,
- **emotion** – short-to-medium bursts like fear, anger, joy, shame,
- **mood** – slower, background weather.

In real life they’re tangled. We’re just teasing them apart a bit so you can see them more clearly when they show up.

### Sensation: the raw-ish physical feel

First, zoom into **body sensation**.

Right now you might notice:

- pressure where you’re sitting or standing,
- temperature on your skin,
- tension in your shoulders or jaw,
- your breath moving,
- maybe a knot somewhere, or some lightness.

These are the more “raw” side of feeling:

- They’re usually **local** (this part of the body).
- They can be described without much story (“warm”, “tight”, “buzzing”, “dull ache”).
- They often change fairly quickly if you move, stretch, adjust posture.

Of course, you can wrap them in story:

- “My chest is tight” → “I’m anxious” → “Everything is falling apart”.

But before that story, there’s just:

> a certain **texture** in a certain **region** of the field.

For now, it’s useful to notice that this layer exists at all:

- sensations can be watched as **just sensations**,
- without immediately jumping to identity or narrative.

We’ll use this later when we talk about working with difficulty.

### Emotion: organised waves

Now think of something that recently made you:

- angry,
- scared,
- sad,
- joyful,
- ashamed,
- excited.

As you recall it, notice what happens:

- specific body zones light up (chest, throat, belly, face),
- patterns of thought fire up (“how could they…”, “this is amazing”, “I’m such an idiot”),
- there’s a sense of movement:
  - push away,
  - pull toward,
  - collapse inward,
  - rise up,
  - reach out.

Compared to simple sensation, **emotion** tends to be:

- more **organised** – it comes as a pattern: body + thoughts + urge + meaning,
- more **tagged** – “this is anger / fear / joy / shame”,
- more **about something** – an object, a situation, a person, a memory.

In the field, an emotion is not just “a feeling in the body” or “a thought”.  
It’s more like a **coordinated mode** the whole system enters.

You can often recognise:

- **fear** by its very specific cocktail of:

  - body: tension, jitter, cold, tightness,
  - thoughts: scanning, “what if”, projecting bad outcomes,
  - urges: freeze, run, hide, appease.

- **anger** by:

  - body: heat, expansion in chest/arms, clenched jaw,
  - thoughts: “this is wrong”, “how dare they”,
  - urges: push, attack, confront, draw a boundary.

- **shame** by:
  - body: collapse, wanting to hide, heaviness, heat in face,
  - thoughts: “I am bad / disgusting / unlovable”,
  - urges: disappear, fix yourself, placate.

We’re not cataloguing emotions exhaustively.  
The important point is:

> Emotions are **patterns in the field** that involve:  
> sensation, thoughts, urges, and a “this is about X” orientation.

### Mood: background weather

Now tune into the **overall tone** of your day so far.

If you’re honest, it’s probably something like:

- low-key okay,
- mildly restless,
- a bit flat,
- quietly content,
- slightly irritable,
- vaguely heavy,
- pleasantly buzzy.

That’s **mood**:

- slower to change than specific emotions,
- not always clearly about something,
- often there even when nothing “big” is happening.

If emotions are like **waves** in the field, moods are more like **the climate**:

- the same event (say, a message from a friend) will land very differently in:
  - a depressed mood,
  - an anxious mood,
  - a playful mood.

In terms of appearance:

- mood is a **background colouring** of the field,
- sometimes with a location (heaviness in the body),
- sometimes more diffuse.

You might not notice a mood until something bumps against it:

- someone invites you out and you feel an immediate _“ugh, no”_ → oh, right, I’m in a withdrawn mood.
- someone compliments you and it barely lands → oh, right, I’m in a numb/flat mood.

### All three at once

In real life, sensation, emotion, and mood are usually layered.

For example:

- You’re in a **low-level anxious mood** all week.
- At work, your boss criticises something → a **burst of shame** and **anger**.
- In the moment, there are **specific sensations**:
  - heat in the face,
  - lurch in the stomach,
  - tightness in the chest.

Or:

- You’re in a **neutral-to-good mood**.
- Someone suddenly slams a door → **burst of fear**.
- Sensations: heart rate spike, jolt in the body.
- Emotion fades, mood mostly stays.

It can be useful to ask, when you’re overwhelmed:

- What’s the **immediate sensation**?
- What’s the **specific emotion** pattern?
- What’s the **background mood**?

You don’t have to force clean boundaries, but even a rough separation can stop everything collapsing into one blob of “I feel like shit and don’t know why.”

### Feelings as part of “what appears”

In the original “What Appears” lens, feeling was described as:

> the **felt quality** of how the current organisation of experience is going from here.

When:

- the world seems understandable enough,
- the self-story basically matches events,
- the time-story holds together,

the field can feel:

- easy,
- flowing,
- or at least workable.

When:

- there’s a mismatch between how things are grouped and what’s actually happening,
- stories and reality keep colliding,
- important bits are being ignored or suppressed,

the field can feel:

- tense,
- brittle,
- chaotic,
- stuck.

This isn’t a moral judgement. It’s a **status signal**.

We’ll dig into that more in the next chapter when we talk about **valence** and **pull**.

For now:

- Sensations, emotions, and moods are **part of what appears**.
- They’re not noise on top of “real” experience.
- They are a way the system **senses itself and its fit with the current situation**.

### A light check-in

If you want to ground this right now, pause and see if you can name:

- one or two **sensations** (e.g. “tightness in shoulders”, “warmth in hands”),
- the current **mood** in 2–3 words (e.g. “a bit foggy, slightly tense”),
- any **emotion** that’s around, even subtly (e.g. “trace of worry”, “mild irritation”, “quiet curiosity”).

Then see if you can also feel:

- what kind of **fit** the current organisation seems to have:
  - “mostly workable”,
  - “strained but holding”,
  - “barely holding”,
  - “not workable at all”.

You don’t need to analyse it.  
We’re just learning to see feeling as **part of the field’s status display**, not as an enemy to get rid of.
