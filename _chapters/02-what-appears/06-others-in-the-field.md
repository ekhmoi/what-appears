## DRAFT - Others in What Appears

So far, “what appears” has mostly been described from one side:

- the room,
- the body,
- the sense of “here”,
- time and story,
- and the beginnings of “me”.

But most of a human life doesn’t happen alone in a white room.

Other people, and often animals, are a huge part of what shows up in the field:

- faces,
- voices,
- messages,
- expectations,
- warmth,
- threat,
- absence.

This chapter is about how **others** appear inside the same lens.

Not yet about conflict, repair, or ethics — that’s Part III.  
Here we’re still just in:

> “What is it like when other humans show up in what appears?”

### Others as patterns in the field

---

From your side, other people appear as:

- bodies: shapes, movements, proximity, touch,
- sound: voices, tone, rhythm, silence,
- expressions: faces, posture, micro-signals,
- traces: messages, social media, emails, pictures, memories.

All of that is part of the **field**, right now.

On top of that, compressions kick in:

- **“friend”**, **“stranger”**, **“boss”**, **“partner”**, **“family”**, **“they/them”**,
- “likes me / dislikes me / neutral / dangerous / boring / attractive / out of my league”.

Each label is a **clump**:

- many details and memories bundled into one “type of person”.

Already you can see:

> other people aren’t blank objects in the field.  
> They show up as _structured_ patterns with a lot baked in.

### The sense of “another centre”

---

There’s also something stranger and more basic:

When you look at a chair, you don’t usually feel like it has a field of its own.

When you look at a person (or an animal you know well), often there’s a sense of:

- “there is **someone** there, not just a thing.”

That shows up as:

- eyes that look back,
- a sense of being seen or not seen,
- an intuition that they have:
  - their own inside,
  - their own worries,
  - their own feeling of being “me”.

You can’t see their field.  
But:

- your system runs a **model** of “another field over there”,
- and feelings organise around that:
  - care,
  - fear,
  - curiosity,
  - shame,
  - attraction,
  - rivalry.

In this lens, we can say:

> “Other minds” appear as **inferred centres** in the field —  
> patterns that the system treats as if they have their own version of what you’re reading about.

We’ll lean on that “as if” more in Part III.

### Social structure in the field

---

Once other people show up, the structure of the field changes.

A few things happen:

- **Figure/ground shifts**

  - in a crowded room, some faces snap into figure, others blur into background,
  - your attention tracks people who matter more to your self-story.

- **Near/far reconfigures**

  - someone across the room can feel “closer” than the person next to you,
  - because of emotional salience, not physical distance.

- **Inside/outside blurs**

  - someone’s imagined opinion of you can live _inside_ your chest,
  - while their actual body is “outside” across town.

- **Here/there becomes social**

  - “here” is not just “this body in this room,”
  - it’s “me in this social situation,”
  - with invisible lines of:
    - status,
    - belonging,
    - expectation.

The presence (or imagined presence) of others reshapes:

- what feels possible,
- what feels dangerous,
- what feels meaningful.

Same physical room.  
Very different field if you’re alone vs with your parents vs with a lover vs with a hostile crowd.

---

### Other animals

---

Non-human animals can also appear as:

- **things** (a dog-shaped piece of environment),
- **symbols** (“danger”, “cute”, “food”),
- or as **centres** (“this one creature who knows me.”)

If you’ve ever had a close relationship with an animal, you probably know the shift:

- from “a cat” to “this cat”,
- from “a dog” to “this one, with this personality, this history with me.”

The field then includes:

- your model of their inner life,
- your care or fear,
- your roles (protector, owner, companion, threat).

The point here isn’t to argue about how conscious animals are.  
It’s simply to notice:

> for many of us, other creatures already appear as more than furniture.  
> They show up as partial centres in the field.

---

### Self and others: basic pattern

---

As soon as there is:

- a **self-compression** (“me”),
- and **other-centre compressions** (“you”, “them”),

the field starts running basic patterns like:

- “me vs you”,
- “us vs them”,
- “above / below / equal”,
- “wanted / unwanted”,
- “safe / unsafe”.

Those patterns:

- get shaped by personal history (family, culture, trauma, queerness, etc.),
- show up as strong feelings (shame, jealousy, love, rage, loyalty, grief),
- and will be a big part of what we call “difficulty” later.

For now, the important thing is just:

- others are a **core part** of what appears,
- not an optional late add-on.

---

### Why this matters for later parts

---

We’ll come back to others in:

- **Part II** – when we talk about feelings like shame, love, and anger, which live on self ↔ other axes,
- **Part III** – when we look at boundaries, repair, and seeing others as “other fields” rather than just props in your story.

This chapter is just to mark:

> from the very beginning,  
> what appears is not just a private theatre.  
> It’s already a social field.
