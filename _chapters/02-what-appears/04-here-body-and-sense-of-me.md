## Here, This Body, and the Sense of “Me”

We’ve been talking about:

- the **field** – the whole situation of experience at once,
- **structure** – patterns like figure/background, near/far, inside/outside,
- **clumping** – how the field bundles complexity into usable “things”.

Now we’ll look at a very particular “thing”:

> this _here_, this _body_, this _“me”_.

We’re not going to decide what you “really are”.  
We’re just going to look at how **“me-ness” appears** in the field.

### The felt centre: “here”

Most of the time, there’s some sense of a **centre** in the field.

Right now, check for yourself:

- There’s a sense of _“I am here, reading.”_
- Sounds are “over there” relative to here.
- Objects are “in front of me”, “behind me”, “to the side”.
- Even thoughts sort of “happen to me” or “go through my head”.

This **“here”** isn’t usually a precise point. It’s more like a fuzzy hub:

- somewhere around the head, face, chest – often shifting and vague.

In terms of appearance:

> “Here” is a **structural role** – a place in the field everything else is organised around.

It doesn’t announce itself with a label. It’s just how the field is wired:  
there is a _vantage point-feel_.

### The body as the local cluster

Around this “here”, there’s a fairly stable clump: **the body**.

Try this:

- Bring attention to the sense of your **face** (or the space where it feels like your face is).
- Then to your **hands**.
- Then to your **feet**.
- Then to your **whole body outline**, as best you can.

Notice how:

- there is a cluster of sensations that feel **tied together**,
- they move together when you move,
- they form a kind of **local scaffold** in the field.

That cluster is what appears as **“this body”**.

In raw terms, it’s:

- pressures,
- temperatures,
- tensions,
- movements,
- internal sensations.

Wrapped together, clumped, and tagged (usually) as:

> **“my body”**

Again, this is describing how it _appears_, not explaining biology. We’re staying in the phenomenological layer.

### Inside the body vs outside the body

Earlier we talked about **inside / outside** in general.

The body gives that split a concrete anchor:

- “Inside” often means _inside-the-body_ – chest, gut, throat, head.
- “Outside” often means _outside-the-body_ – room, objects, other people.

When you feel:

- “a knot in my stomach”,
- “tightness in my chest”,
- “pressure in my throat”,

those aren’t just neutral sensations. They’re heavily tagged as:

- **in here**,
- **in this body**,
- **happening to me**.

The body is like a **high-priority region** of the field:  
things that light up there tend to matter more.

We’ll lean on this later when we talk about feelings and difficulty.  
For now, just notice how strongly “inside-body” maps to “in here / mine”.

---

### A first pass at “me”

Let’s stack what we have:

- a **centre / here** in the field,
- a **local cluster** of sensations (the body),
- a sense that things happening here/this-body are **“mine”**.

On top of that, there’s usually:

- a **name**,
- a **history**,
- roles and identities (“son”, “friend”, “engineer”, “believer”, “ex-believer”, “queer”, etc.).

All of that can clump together into a **proto-sense of “me”**:

> “I am this one, here; this body, this centre, with this history.”

You don’t have to think this sentence consciously.  
Most of the time it’s just the background assumption of the field:

- actions go out from here,
- experiences come into here,
- this cluster is the **subject** of what’s going on.

We don’t need to call it an illusion or a truth.  
We can just notice:

> A lot of the field is organised around a **“me” clump**.

### The “me” clump isn’t one thing

If you pay closer attention, “me” is not a single object. It’s more like a **stack**.

Try sampling a few flavours of “me”:

1. **Body-me**

   - Sense of weight, posture, breath.
   - “I feel tired / energised / heavy / light.”

2. **Social-me**

   - How you appear in the imagined eyes of others.
   - “I’m the weird one / responsible one / failure / success.”

3. **Story-me**

   - Narrative about your past and future.
   - “I am someone who always… / never… / wants to…”

4. **Moral-me**

   - Sense of being good/bad, worthy/unworthy.
   - Often shaped by family, religion, culture.

5. **System-me** (more subtle)
   - The feeling of being the one who has to manage it all.
   - “I’m the one who has to figure this out.”

All of these are different **compressions** in the field. Together, they’re often treated as a single object: “me”.

It’s useful to see that:

- different situations light up different layers,
- the “me” that shows up in a work meeting is not the same as the “me” that shows up in bed crying at 2am,
- but they’re felt as versions of the **same** underlying someone.

That **continuity-feel** is important. We’ll touch it more when we bring in time and story.

### A quick scan of your own “me-stack”

You don’t have to go deep; just take a snapshot.

Right now:

- What’s the **body-me** like? Any obvious tensions, comfort, restlessness?
- If you imagine someone you respect watching you read this, what does **social-me** feel like?
- If you think the thought “I am someone who…” — what completes that sentence? (**story-me**)
- Is there any sense of being fundamentally good/bad/okay/not-okay? (**moral-me**)
- Is there a feeling of being “the one in charge of this life”? Tight? Relaxed? (**system-me**)

You don’t need to fix or judge any of it.  
Just see how many layers are packed into the simple word **“I”**.

---

### Why this matters

We’re doing all this groundwork because:

- later, when we talk about **difficult feelings**,  
  many of them cluster _around_ this “me” clump.

For example:

- Shame often hits **social-me** and **moral-me**.
- Anxiety often hits **system-me** (“I have to handle a future I can’t predict”).
- Body-level dread can make the entire “here/body” feel unsafe.

If all of that is blurred into one opaque unit, it’s easy to get overwhelmed and think:

> “I am bad. I am broken. I am unsafe.”

If you can see **how “me” is put together in appearance**, there’s more room to:

- stabilise the bits that need support,
- soften or reconfigure bits that are too tight.

We’re not there yet. One more ingredient is missing:

- **time** – the sense of before/after, and
- **story** – how the field strings moments into “my life”.

That’s the next chapter.
