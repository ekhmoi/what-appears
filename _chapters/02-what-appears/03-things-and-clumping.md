## Things and Clumping

So far we’ve talked about:

- the **field** – the whole situation of experience at once,
- **structure** – patterns like figure/background, near/far, inside/outside.

Now we’ll look at how the field shows up not just as loose patterns, but as **things**.

Obvious things like:

- this chair,
- that tree,
- my phone,

and less obvious ones like:

- this project,
- that relationship,
- my personality,
- “the future”.

All of these are ways the field **clumps** detail into usable chunks.

### Room as one blob vs room as many things

Try this with the room you’re in (or the space around you).

First pass:

- Soften your gaze.
- Don’t name anything.
- Let the whole visual field be one **continuous blob** of colour, light, and shape.

You might still know conceptually “that’s a table, that’s a wall”, but try not to lean on the labels. Just let it all be a spread.

Second pass:

- Now deliberately start naming:
  - _“chair… table… screen… plant… door… cup…”_
- Let each thing pop out as a separate **unit**.

Notice the difference:

- In blob-mode, the room is more like **one field** with variations.
- In thing-mode, it’s more like a **collection of objects**.

Nothing about the photons changed between the two modes.  
What changed was how the field is **organised**.

### Clumping: from detail to a “thing”

A “thing” is not a raw sense impression. It’s a **clump** of many small bits:

Take “phone” for example.

In experience, “phone” can include:

- the specific shape and outline,
- the weight in your hand,
- the way the surface feels,
- the expectation that it will light up if you press a button,
- a whole bundle of associations (messages, people, work, distraction).

All of that gets compressed into a single usable unit: **“my phone”**.

Most of the time, you don’t consciously access all the micro-details. You just get the one chunk and its affordances:

- “I can pick this up.”
- “I can unlock it.”
- “I can call someone.”
- “I can scroll until I forget I exist.”

That chunking is what I’ll casually call **clumping**.

Later I’ll formalise it more and call it **compression**, but for now the main point is:

> Experience shows up as “things” by **clumping a lot of detail into simple, actionable units**.

### Clumping isn’t just for physical objects

The same kind of thing happens for more abstract “things”:

- **“This relationship”**  
  – a vast history of interactions, feelings, stories, hopes, fears, all clumped into one unit: “me and X”.

- **“My career”**  
  – projects, skills, status, money, images of the future, all clumped together.

- **“My trauma”** or **“my mental health”**  
  – many episodes, sensations, reactions, diagnoses, all wrapped into one heavy “thing”.

When you think “I can’t handle my life right now”, often you’re looking at a **huge clump** that’s being treated as one object.

It’s not wrong that this happens. It’s often necessary. You can’t micro-manage every pixel of experience all the time.

But it’s useful to see that:

- there’s a difference between **the raw richness of what appears**, and
- the **clumped units** we use to navigate it.

### Why clumping is useful

If you had to consciously track:

- every pixel of colour,
- every muscle micro-tension,
- every single association,

you’d never get out of bed.

Clumping gives you:

- **speed** – you don’t have to rediscover “cup” from scratch every morning.
- **predictability** – “door” comes with an expectation it will open when pushed.
- **coordination** – other people share many of the same clumps (“tree”, “train”, “meeting”), so you can talk and act together.

From a system design perspective, clumping is a kind of **optimisation**:

- high-resolution data → low-resolution **handles** that are fast to use.

The cost is that handles are coarse. They can hide important differences.  
But without them, you’d drown.

### When clumping starts to hurt

The same mechanism that keeps you functional can also make you stuck.

Examples:

- “I am a failure”  
  – takes many events, feelings, and stories and fuses them into one object-self.

- “They hate me”  
  – compresses a few ambiguous signals into a solid, hostile entity.

- “My life is a mess”  
  – clumps together unrelated difficulties into one overwhelming blob.

From inside the field, these clumps feel like **facts**:

- _“I just see that I’m a failure.”_
- _“Obviously they hate me.”_
- _“Look at my life, it’s one big mess.”_

But if you deliberately **de-clump** a little — look at the pieces — often the picture shifts:

- Some things are going badly, some are neutral, some are fine.
- Some people dislike you, some are indifferent, some care.
- Some skills you’re bad at, some you’re decent at, some you’re good at.

We’ll come back to this in Part III when we talk about working with difficult feelings. For now the key observation is:

> Suffering often happens **at the level of clumps**:  
> when a coarse “thing” absorbs more and more of the field and becomes _the_ story.

### A small experiment: de-clumping just a bit

Pick one “thing” that’s mildly uncomfortable but not your deepest wound. Maybe:

- “this project I’m avoiding”,
- “this person I’m tense around”,
- “this habit I’m ashamed of”.

Hold that “thing” in mind and notice how it appears in your field:

- Is it a picture? A sentence? A feeling in the body?
- Does it feel near or far? Inside or outside? Heavy or light?

Now ask very gently:

- What **smaller bits** make this up?

For example, “this project” could de-clump into:

- a certain file or task,
- a conversation you’re dreading,
- a memory of a past failure,
- a physical feeling in your chest when you think about it.

You don’t have to “solve” anything. Just notice how the big clump is actually many smaller appearances glued together.

### Where we’re heading

So far, we have:

- The **field** – the whole situation of experience at once.
- **Structure** – patterns like figure/background, near/far, inside/outside.
- **Clumping** – how the field gives us “things” by bundling detail into usable units.

In the next chapters we’ll look at a particularly important clump:

- **“here”** and **“this body”**, and how a **sense of “me”** grows around that.

We’ll keep staying close to how it actually appears, not jumping (yet) into big theories of what the self “really is”.
