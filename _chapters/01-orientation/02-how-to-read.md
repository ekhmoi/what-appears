## How to Read This

This isn’t meant to be consumed as doctrine. It’s meant to be played with.

Here are a few ways to do that.

### Basic stance

#### Compare, don’t believe

Whenever I describe something, don’t ask:

> “Is this ultimately true?”

Ask:

> “Does anything like this actually happen in _my_ experience?”

If yes, good — now we have shared ground.  
If no, also good — now we know we’re different somewhere. You don’t have to force it.

#### Stay close to your own field

Especially in Parts I–III, it’ll help if you literally look up from the page sometimes and check:

- What’s in my visual field right now?
- What’s the sense of “here”?
- What’s the emotional weather?
- Where do thoughts, memories, plans show up?

Let the text point back to **what appears for you**, not to an abstract diagram.

#### Treat models as tools, not laws

When I talk about “field”, “compression”, “awareness-mode”, “world-level”, and so on later in the book, I’m not describing cosmic laws.

I’m saying:

> “If you look at experience _as if_ it were organised like this, some things might hurt less and make more sense.”

If a lens doesn’t help — or makes you feel more broken — you can put it down. No loyalty oath required.

### Noticing when a lens hurts

Sometimes clever frameworks turn into weapons:

- “If there’s no real self, why am I still suffering? I must be doing it wrong.”
- “If everything is just appearance, then nothing matters, so I’m an idiot for caring.”

If you notice this kind of thing happening while reading, treat that as valuable information:

- Maybe this particular lens is too sharp for this moment.
- Maybe you need more stabilising (clearer “I”, clearer boundaries) and less dissolving.
- Or the reverse.

You can always slow down, skip ahead, or close the book. That’s not failure; it’s the system protecting itself.

### Roadmap

Here’s the rough flow of the book:

- **Part I – This Orientation**

- **Part II – What Appears**  
  We start from right now: what’s showing up in experience? Field, world, body, self, time, story — described from the inside, without heavy theory.

- **Part III – How Feelings Appear**  
  We bring in sensation, emotion, mood, and especially uncertainty. How do anxiety, shame, anger, and numbness actually show themselves in the same field?

- **Part IV – Working With Difficulty**  
  We look at what difficult feelings tend to point at, and introduce two basic moves:

  - stabilising around a trustworthy “I”,
  - letting the situation breathe and soften.  
    There are concrete walk-throughs.

- **Part V – Architecture**  
  This is the nerd layer. We revisit everything through the lens of field and compression and sketch one possible “architecture of appearance”. Optional but connected.

- **Part VI – Epilogue**  
  Where this overlaps with religious, contemplative, and scientific traditions, and some suggestions for further experiments that don’t turn this into a new dogma.

### Who I’m imagining as I write

I’m imagining readers who:

- have lived inside a strong, total story (religious, ideological, whatever),
- have parts of themselves that story couldn’t digest (sexuality, doubt, strange experiences),
- have gone or are going through the rebel phase,
- maybe have touched altered states or nondual language and don’t quite know what to do with them,
- and often have at least a bit of “engineer brain”: they want things to actually hang together.

If that’s you, you don’t need to become “spiritual” or “rationalist” to make use of this. You just need enough curiosity to look at your own experience a bit more closely — and enough self-respect not to force yourself into compressions that don’t fit.

From here, we start where we actually are:  
not in theory, not in memory, not in someone else’s authority — but right now, in what appears.
