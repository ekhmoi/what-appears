Totally fair question, and also: very normal “first book” anxiety 🙂

Short answer:

* **Content-wise:** what we have in Part 0 is *fine* (it’s not bloated for a serious non-fiction book).

* **Reader-experience-wise:** it could feel a bit dense, and there *is* an easy way to slim it down without losing the spine.

Let me break that down and then I’ll give you a **leaner Part 0** you can choose instead.

---

## **1\. Is this “too much” for Part 0?**

For a non-fiction book like this, Part 0 basically has to do three jobs:

1. **Where I’m coming from** (your story, why you care).

2. **What this is / isn’t** (boundary-setting, expectations).

3. **How to read this / roadmap.**

What we wrote *does exactly those three things*, in one go. That’s structurally normal.

The *feeling* of “too much” is coming from:

* We’re doing all three jobs in **two chapters** right away.

* The voice is pretty tight and information-dense (not fluffy), so it *reads* packed.

* You’ve never written a book before, so your internal “scope sense” is still calibrating.

For a typical 200–250 page book, what we wrote is like a **6–8 page intro**. That’s not crazy at all.

So: you’re not fucking it up. This is a legit-sized Part 0\.

## **2\. If you want it leaner, what should shrink?**

If you *do* want to slim it, here’s how I’d do it without amputating the important bits:

### **Keep, but tighter**

**In 0.1 (“Why I’m Looking…”), keep these beats:**

* Strict Muslim upbringing \+ pre-packaged world.

* Queer attraction as hard clash with that package.

* Rebel/atheist move as first stabilisation.

* Psychedelics cracking the flat map.

* Engineer/architect brain asking “what’s the actual architecture here?”

* “Not new metaphysics; this is a way of looking at experience.”

Everything else is flavour you *can* cut or shorten.

### **In 0.2 (“How to Read This”), keep:**

* Quick “what this is not” (one paragraph, not four).

* One paragraph of “what this is” (user manual / arch doc metaphor).

* A short roadmap bullet list of the parts.

And maybe:

* Drop or shrink the numbered list of “how to actually read this” to just 2–3 compact points.

---

## **3\. A leaner version you can swap in**

Here’s a **more compact Part 0** with the same tone, fewer words. If you like this feel better, you can treat this as v2.

---

### **Part 0 – Orientation**

*Where This Is Coming From*

---

#### **0.1 – Why I’m Looking at “What Appears”**

I didn’t start here because I was curious about consciousness.  
 I started here because my life wouldn’t fit the story it was given.

I grew up in a strict Muslim family. God, morality, gender, the future — all of it arrived pre-labelled:

* This is right.

* This is wrong.

* This is who you are.

Inside that, there wasn’t much slack.

At the same time, I was attracted to men.

I didn’t have theory for it. It was just a simple, persistent fact in my experience. A pull. A way my body and feelings oriented around certain people. And it clashed hard with the story I’d been handed.

If I borrow language from later in the book: the “compressions” I had around self, gender, and morality didn’t match what was actually showing up in my field of experience. Story said one thing. Life said another.

You can’t live like that forever without something breaking.

**My first fix was to burn the story down.**

If the official picture says I’m wrong, and I can’t stop being what I am, maybe the picture is wrong. So I swung into atheism and “be rational, don’t be fooled again.”

That move gave me:

* A way to say “no” to a structure that was crushing me.

* A sense of integrity: I’d rather be honest and damned than obedient and fake.

* A simpler world: no God, no sin, just matter, brains, and social games.

In the language I’ll use later: that was a **stabilising move**. I tightened around a new “I” and a new world-model that felt more trustworthy. It worked — up to a point.

Even inside that flat, atheist frame, some things wouldn’t stay flat.  
 Moments in nature, music, connection, intense emotion — they felt *bigger* than “atoms and social conditioning”. Not as proofs of God, just as data my map didn’t really explain.

Then came LSD and mushrooms.

I’m not selling them as an answer. But they did blow holes in my maps:

* The usual “me” went weirdly transparent or rearranged.

* Reality felt more fluid and constructed than I’d thought.

* There was a wide, non-personal clarity that didn’t fit my current story.

They didn’t hand me a new religion. They did something more annoying: they made it impossible to fully believe the old *or* the new story.

I couldn’t go back to a personal, mythic God handing down rules.  
 I couldn’t fully believe in a flat, emotionally antiseptic materialism either.

Meanwhile, my day job is software engineering / architecture. My brain is trained to think in terms of:

* systems and layers,

* interfaces and invariants,

* messy reality compressed into something usable.

So while all this was happening — religion cracking, atheism cracking, altered states happening — there was also this very nerdy background process running:

“What’s the *architecture* here?  
 How is experience wired?  
 What’s stable? What’s an implementation detail?”

I didn’t want a new spiritual “app”. I wanted to understand the runtime.

That’s basically where this book comes from:  
 a queer ex-Muslim, ex-atheist software architect trying to write one semi-sane systems doc for lived experience, after several failed designs.

At some point I stopped asking:

“What is ultimately real?”

and started asking:

“What is **appearing, right now**, and how is it organised?”

Not as metaphysics. Just as a way to stop fighting my own experience and to understand why certain patterns of suffering kept repeating.

This book is my current answer to that question.

I’m not offering a new religion, a scientific theory, or therapy.  
 I’m offering:

* a way of looking at experience,

* some language for how “world”, “self”, “time”, and “feeling” show up,

* and a couple of simple moves you can try when things get tight.

You don’t have to believe any of it. Just compare it to your own experience. Keep what lands. Ignore the rest.

#### **0.2 – How to Read This (And What It’s Not)**

A few quick boundaries.

**This is not:**

* a religion — no commandments, no hidden group, no faith required;

* a scientific theory — I’m not doing physics or neuroscience here;

* therapy — some ideas might help, but this is not mental-health care;

* a promise — no guarantees of enlightenment, peace, or a fixed self.

**This *is*:**

A user’s manual for “what appears” — written by someone who’s had to rebuild their firmware more than once.

If you’re technical, you can read it as an architecture doc for experience: not The One True Design, but one concrete design that seems to run in production.

You’ll meet:

* **the field** – the whole situation of experience at once;

* **structure** – how some parts feel nearer, important, or “me”;

* **compressions** – how we get usable “things” like objects, selves, stories, futures;

* **two basic moves** for working with difficulty:

  * stabilising around a trustworthy “I”,

  * letting the whole situation breathe and soften.

You don’t need to memorise anything. I’ll build it up slowly, from the inside.

**How to use this book (short version):**

* Don’t treat it as doctrine. Treat it as a set of *lenses*.

* When I describe something, check against your own experience.

* If a lens makes you feel more broken or more fake, that’s useful data — not a moral verdict. You can put the lens down.

**Roadmap:**

* **Part I – What Appears**: starting from right now — world, body, self, time, story.

* **Part II – How Feelings Appear**: how sensation, mood, and especially uncertainty show up in the same field.

* **Part III – Working With Difficulty**: what difficult feelings point to, and the two moves (stabilise / dissolve) with concrete examples.

* **Part IV – Architecture**: optional nerd layer — field and compression as one possible “architecture of appearance”.

* **Part V – Epilogue**: where this overlaps with religious, contemplative, and scientific traditions, and some suggestions for experimenting without turning this into a new dogma.

I’m imagining readers who:

* have lived inside a strong, totalising story (religious, ideological, whatever),

* have parts of themselves that story couldn’t digest (like sexuality, doubt, weird experiences),

* have gone or are going through the rebel phase,

* maybe have touched altered states or nondual language,

* and don’t want to lie to themselves anymore, in *any* direction.

If that’s you, you don’t have to become “spiritual” or “rationalist” to use this. You just need enough curiosity to look at your own experience a little more closely — and enough self-respect not to force yourself into compressions that don’t fit.

From here, we start where we actually are:  
 not in theory, not in memory, not in someone else’s authority — but right now, in what appears.

---

If this leaner version feels better in your body, use it.  
 If the original fuller one feels more “ah, that’s me”, keep that.

Either way, you’re not overpacking in some catastrophic way — you’re in the normal range, and we can always refactor later once more of the book exists.
