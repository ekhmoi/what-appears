# Recap: A Simple Map of What Appears

We’ve covered a lot in Part I, but it all comes back to something very simple:

> Right now, there is a **field** of experience,  
> and it is already **structured** and **clumped** in specific ways.

This chapter is just a quick map of what we’ve seen, so we can carry it forward.

---

## The field

We started with the most basic observation:

- There is **something** present.
- A whole **situation** shows up at once: sights, sounds, body sensations, thoughts, moods, memories, expectations.

We called that:

> **The field** – the whole situation of your experience right now.

Not “the room out there”, not “brain activity in here”.  
Just how it **appears from here**, as one spread.

---

## Structure

Inside the field, things aren’t flat.

We saw a few recurring patterns:

- **Figure / background**

  - some parts are in focus, others fade.

- **Near / far**

  - some things are spatially close,
  - some are emotionally or practically “close” (pressing, live),
  - some are “somewhere in the distance”.

- **Centre / periphery**

  - there’s usually a fuzzy **“here”** – a vantage point,
  - other things are arranged relative to here.

- **Inside / outside**
  - some appearances feel “in here” (body, thoughts, emotions),
  - some feel “out there” (room, world, other people).

Together, these make up what I called **structure**:

> **Structure** – the relational patterning inside the field:  
> how bits of experience stand out, cluster, and line up relative to each other.

You don’t have to remember the term. The important part is that:

- experience has an **organised shape**,
- and that shape can shift.

## Clumping into “things”

On top of this structure, the field also gives us **things**.

We looked at:

- **Room-as-one-blob** vs **room-as-many-objects**.
- How “phone”, “tree”, “this project”, “that relationship” show up as **units**.

We called this:

> **Clumping** – bundling a lot of detail and potential into a simple, usable “thing”.

In the background is the idea of **compression**:

- high-resolution, messy data →
- low-resolution, fast-to-use handles.

Most of the time you don’t see the details; you just see the clump:

- “my phone”,
- “this mess”,
- “my trauma”,
- “my whole life”.

That’s efficient and necessary, but it also means:

- suffering often happens **at the level of clumps**,
- when one big “thing” absorbs more and more of the field and becomes _the_ story.

Later, in Part III and Part IV, I’ll lean more heavily on the word **compression**, but it’s pointing to the same phenomenon we met here as **clumping** and **granularity**.

---

## Here, body, and proto-“me”

We then zoomed in on a particular region of the field:

- the **centre / here**,
- the **body cluster**,
- the stack of patterns we call **“me”**.

We noticed:

- A **fuzzy centre** where perception and action seem to be organised from – a “here”.
- A fairly stable clump of sensations around that – **this body**.
- A set of layered self-flavours:
  - **body-me** (how it feels to inhabit this body),
  - **social-me** (how you appear to others),
  - **story-me** (narratives about who you are),
  - **moral-me** (good/bad, worthy/unworthy),
  - **system-me** (the one who has to manage it all).

All of that piles into a **me-clump**:

> “I am this one, here; this body, this centre, with this history.”

Again, we didn’t decide whether that’s ultimately real or illusory.  
We just noticed that the field is heavily **organised around it**.

That organisation will matter a lot once we bring in feelings and difficulty.

---

## Time, memory, and story

Finally, we looked at how **time** shows up in the same field:

- **Now** – what’s currently vivid.
- **Before** – memories and echoes tagged as “earlier”.
- **After** – imagined futures tagged as “later”.

All of these appear **now**:

- memories as current images, words, feelings,
- expectations as current scenarios and body-felt threat or possibility.

From this, we get a sense of **flow / continuity**:

- “this morning”,
- “this week”,
- “my childhood”,
- “my life so far”.

And when you combine:

- a sense of **me**, with
- a sense of **before/now/after**,

you get **story**:

> “I am someone who…”

Those “I am someone who…” sentences are big clumps:

- many moments of experience →
- one heavy narrative lens.

They don’t just **describe**; they also **filter**:

- they highlight some events as “evidence”,
- dim others as irrelevant or flukes.

---

## One picture so far

Very schematically, Part I has given us something like this:

- **Field**

  - the whole situation of experience at once.

- **Structure inside the field**

  - figure / background,
  - near / far,
  - centre / periphery,
  - inside / outside.

- **Clumps / compressions**

  - objects, situations, roles, problems, “my life”.

- **Here / body / me**

  - a centre and body-cluster,
  - layered self-compressions.

- **Time and story**
  - before / now / after as present appearances,
  - stories as “I am someone who…” compressions.

We’ve still said nothing about:

- what ultimately exists,
- how the brain implements this,
- whether there’s a soul, or pure awareness, or just matter.

We’ve stayed with:

> how things **appear**,  
> how that appearance is **structured**,  
> and how it can be **more coarse or more fine**.

---

## Where we go next

Two big pieces are still mostly in the background:

- **Feeling** – how sensations, emotions, moods, and valence show up in the same field.
- **Difficulty** – what happens when parts of the field feel unsafe, overwhelming, or unsolvable.

In Part II we’ll bring **feelings** into this map:

- how comfort and threat appear,
- how “pull” and “avoidance” feel,
- how uncertainty shows up as a texture, not just as an idea.

We’ll keep using the same ingredients:

- field,
- structure,
- clumping,
- here/body/me,
- time/story,

but now with **affect** lit up.

Once that’s in place, we’ll be able to talk concretely about:

- what anxious, ashamed, angry, numb states are **doing** in the field,
- and later, how the system can re-organise itself in response.

For now, if you take nothing else from Part I, let it be this:

> Whatever else is true about reality,  
> you always have this one honest starting point:  
> **what appears, right now, in your field.**
