# How to Keep Exploring (Without Making It a New Religion)

If this lens feels alive for you, you might want to keep playing with it after the book ends.

This chapter is about how to do that **gently**.

---

## 1. Keep starting from “what appears”

The safest anchor is always:

> “What is actually here, in experience, _right now_?”

You can come back to:

- the **field** – sights, sounds, body, thoughts, feelings, all at once,
- **structure** – figure/background, near/far, inside/outside,
- **clumps** – “things”, identities, problems, stories,
- **feelings** – as readouts of fit/mismatch.

Simple questions like:

- “What is figure for me right now?”
- “What am I treating as the whole story?”
- “What’s the bind this feeling is pointing at?”

are enough to stay in contact with reality.

If you notice you’re lost in abstractions, come back to this.

## 2. Light-touch practice ideas

None of these are obligations. They’re just possible experiments.

### a) Small daily “field snapshots”

Once or twice a day, for 30 seconds:

- notice the field (room, body, thoughts, mood),
- name 1–2 clumps (“this project”, “this relationship”, “this worry”),
- notice valence and pull around them,
- ask what move is needed: a bit more stabilising or a bit more dissolving?

That’s it. No big session. Just little micro-check-ins.

### b) Journaling as compression debugging

When something feels stuck, you can write out:

- “The story my system is running is:  
  _I am someone who… and this means…_”

Then:

- underline the harshest parts,
- ask:
  - “Where did I learn this?”
  - “What doesn’t fit this story?”
- write one alternative working story that is:
  - more honest,
  - less totalising,
  - still admits the pain.

You’re not forcing positive thinking.  
You’re giving the field more than one compression to choose from.

### c) Conversations in this language

If you have close people who like this stuff, you can try talking in this lens:

- “Right now my field is organised as X.”
- “This shame feels like it’s trying to install _I am someone who Y_ again.”
- “I think I need to stabilise here before I try to dissolve anything.”

This is not to show off; it’s to:

- get out of pure content fights (“what happened, who’s right”),
- and talk about **configurations** and **moves**.

That can be surprisingly de-escalating.

## 3. Don’t optimise your whole life around this

Tempting failure mode:

- “If this lens is good, I should apply it to everything, all the time.”

No.

You’re allowed to:

- watch stupid TV,
- flirt,
- write shitty code,
- cook dinner,
- cry,
- dance,
- pray,
- be an animal,
- live.

Some parts of life don’t need a lens at all.  
Some parts need totally different ones.

If you notice you’re:

- delaying decisions until you’ve analysed them through five layers of field/compression,
- or policing your experience for “proper phenomenology”,

that’s a sign to:

- drop the lens for that moment,
- do something simple and human,
- come back later if you want.

## 4. Watch for self-weaponisation

Red flags that you’re using this against yourself:

- “If I were doing this right, I wouldn’t feel this anymore.”
- “This is just a story, so I should shut up about it.”
- “If I were truly nondual, I wouldn’t need boundaries.”
- “I’m bad at stabilising/dissolving, so I’m failing at the book.”

Whenever you catch that, you can literally say:

- “Okay, new story:  
   _‘I am someone who is learning, and my system is doing the best it can right now.’_”

Then:

- stabilise around that,
- or, if that feels too fake, at least around:
  - “I am someone who is overwhelmed and still here.”

You’re not a test case.  
You’re a life.

## 5. When to bring other tools and people in

Some situations are bigger than any lens:

- severe depression,
- active addiction,
- acute trauma,
- psychosis,
- suicidality,
- unsafe environments.

In those cases, the most skilled move may be:

- getting help **outside** this frame:
  - therapy,
  - psychiatry,
  - crisis lines,
  - shelters,
  - legal support,
  - community,
  - friends.

It’s not a failure to say:

> “My architecture diagram is not enough.  
> I need other humans and other tools.”

If anything, that’s a very clean kind of seeing.

## 6. Let the lens age

Lenses change as you use them.

Over time you might find that:

- some parts of this book stay central,
- some parts feel naive,
- some parts you’ve outgrown,
- some parts only make sense years later.

That’s normal.

You can treat the whole thing as:

- one snapshot of one mind at a particular moment in its development,
- that you get to be in conversation with.

You don’t have to freeze yourself around it.  
You can fold it into whatever you become next.

If at some point you look back and think:

- “Wow, I can see how this was incomplete,”

that’s not an indictment of the lens.  
It’s a sign that **you** have more resolution now.
