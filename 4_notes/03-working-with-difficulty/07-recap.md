# Recap: Working With Difficulty Inside Experience

Part III was about moving from **description** to **doing**.

Given everything from Parts I & II — field, self, story, feelings, uncertainty — we asked:

> When the field is in a painful, stuck configuration,  
> what moves are actually available from the inside?

Here’s the compressed version.

---

## 1. Difficult feelings as status messages

Instead of treating anxiety, shame, anger, numbness, etc. as:

- glitches,
- moral failures,
- proof that you’re bad at being human,

we treated them as:

> **status messages** about how the current organisation of self / world / time is going from here.

Roughly:

- they’re not random;
- they’re pointing at **relationships** that feel impossible or unsafe:
  - self ↔ others,
  - self ↔ world,
  - self ↔ future,
  - self ↔ own standards.

The key question became:

> “What is this feeling saying  
> about how I’m currently holding myself, others, and the future?”

## 2. Move One – stabilise around a trustworthy “I”

First big move:

> **Stabilise** – tighten just enough around a sane, honest “I”  
> so that a next step becomes possible.

In practice, that looked like:

- **Body-level**

  - coming back to weight, breath, the actual room.

- **Values and preferences**

  - remembering what _you_ actually care about in this situation.

- **Boundaries**

  - redrawing edges:
    - what is and isn’t yours to carry,
    - what you will and won’t tolerate.

- **Story**
  - shifting from cruel identities (“I am trash / broken / a monster”)
  - to more truthful, workable ones:
    - “I’m someone who did X, cares about it, and is trying to respond.”

When stabilising is going well, the field feels:

- a bit more **here**,
- a bit less chaotic,
- a bit clearer on “this is me, this is not me”,
- able to take **one small next action**.

## 3. Move Two – letting the situation breathe (dissolve)

Second big move:

> **Dissolve** – loosen compressions and splits that are too tight,  
> so the system has more room to move.

In practice, that meant:

- **De-clumping**

  - breaking “my whole life is a mess” into specific, more workable pieces.

- **De-centering “me”**

  - seeing situations as patterns with many contributors,
  - not just “about me being fundamentally defective.”

- **Softening inside/outside**
  - noticing how “world”, “others”, and “me” appear as patterns in the field,
  - relaxing some of the sharpest edges where they hurt more than they help.

Sometimes, for some people, this includes:

- glimpses where the usual “subject in here vs world out there” framing relaxes,
- a more non-dual flavour:
  - one field, many patterns, fewer metaphysical splits.

When dissolving is going well, the field feels:

- less **claustrophobic**,
- less organised around one total story,
- more able to hold multiple truths at once,
- a little more spacious around the problem.

---

## 4. Weaving the two moves

We saw that:

- **all stabilise, no dissolve** → brittle identities, constant collision with reality.
- **all dissolve, no stabilise** → drift, bypassing, “nothing matters” fog.

So in practice you get **sequences**, like:

- **Stabilise → then dissolve**

  - when you’re fragile or overwhelmed.
  - First: body, safety, simple “I”.
  - Later: question harsh stories, widen the frame.

- **Dissolve → then stabilise**
  - when you’re locked in one rigid, self-attacking narrative.
  - First: loosen “this moment defines my whole life”.
  - Then: stabilise in a kinder, more accurate self-story and act from there.

We also noted a rough rule of thumb:

- if things feel **too loose / unreal / ungrounded** → lean on stabilising;
- if things feel **too tight / no-way-out / over-defined** → lean on dissolving.

---

## 5. Concrete mini-walkthroughs

We anchored this with simple examples:

- anxiety about a big choice,
- shame after saying something harsh,
- numbness in a long rough patch,
- anger at being mistreated.

Each one showed:

- the **configuration** of the field (what’s happening in body, attention, story),
- what the feeling seemed to be **pointing at**,
- how stabilising and dissolving could **shift the organisation**.

The aim was not to produce scripts, but to:

- train your eye to see these moves in your own life,
- give you a few remembered “shapes” to recognise when things flare.

---

## 6. Staying oriented when things get intense

Finally, we added some guardrails:

- you’re allowed to be **ordinary**; no obligation to be profound, enlightened, or special,
- don’t use this lens to **gaslight yourself** (“it’s all just appearances, so my pain isn’t real”),
- be wary of **sudden total conclusions** (“nothing is real”, “I must burn everything down”),
- when in doubt, zoom back to **very basic checks**:
  - food, sleep, body, connection, fresh air,
- other humans, therapy, meds, community are all **allowed**; this book isn’t a purity test,
- you can **drop the lens entirely** if it stops helping.

If you had to compress Part III into one sentence:

> When the field is in pain, you can relate to that pain as  
> a signal about the current organisation —  
> and you have at least two deep ways to respond from the inside:  
> **stabilise** what needs more form, and **dissolve** what’s too tight.
