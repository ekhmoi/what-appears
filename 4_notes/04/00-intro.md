# Part IV – Architecture: Making Sense of It All

If you’ve read this far, you’ve already met most of the pieces:

- **field** – the whole situation of experience at once,
- **structure** – figure/background, near/far, inside/outside, centre/periphery,
- **clumps / compressions** – “things”, projects, problems, self-stories,
- **me-stack** – body-me, social-me, story-me, moral-me, system-me,
- **time + story** – before/now/after, and “I am someone who…”,
- **feelings** – how the system senses fit/mismatch from here,
- **difficulty + moves** – how the field responds (stabilise / dissolve) when it’s in trouble.

We’ve mostly stayed close to **what appears from the inside**, using models only as scaffolding.

Part IV is for the part of you that wants to see **one coherent system picture**:

> If I take all these ingredients seriously,  
> what kind of architecture of experience do they suggest?

The plan here is:

1. Lay out **field and compression** as a compact way of talking.
2. Introduce **awareness-mode** and **world-level** as particular regimes of compression.
3. Show how **self, mind, and time** fit as compressions in that same frame.
4. Talk about **differentiation vs duality**, and what nondual clarity looks like in this language.

This is still not metaphysics.  
I’m not claiming “this is what reality ultimately is”.

Think of it like:

> an architecture document for a running system  
> that you can check against your own logs (experience).

It should:

- make some things that used to be mysterious feel more workable,
- connect everyday experience, difficult states, and “weird” states without spaghetti,
- stay compatible with both a scientific and a contemplative angle without fully collapsing into either.

If you’re already saturated, you can skip this part and go to the epilogue.  
If you’re still nerd-hungry, let’s compress everything into one model and see what breaks.
