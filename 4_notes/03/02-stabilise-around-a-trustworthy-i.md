# Move One – Stabilise Around a Trustworthy “I”

The first big move the system can make in difficulty is:

> **stabilising** – firming up a sense of “I”, values, and boundaries  
> so that a next step becomes possible.

You already do this instinctively:

- remembering what you care about,  
- talking to someone who “knows you”,  
- straightening your back,  
- saying “no” or “yes” clearly,  
- deciding “okay, I’ll do this, not that”.

Here we’ll look at this move more deliberately, in field terms.

## Why stabilising helps

When the field is in:

- high uncertainty,  
- tangled pull,  
- blurred or self-attacking stories,

one problem is:

- there’s no clear **centre** from which to act.

“Me” might feel:

- too fuzzy,  
- too split,  
- too contaminated by everyone else’s expectations,  
- or too collapsed into “I am just this one flaw.”

In that situation, stabilising means:

- **clarifying** who is actually here,  
- **remembering** what matters to this one,  
- **redrawing** a few key boundaries,  
- **committing** to small, concrete moves.

It’s a way of saying:

> “Okay, given this mess,  
> what can *this* ‘I’ honestly stand for and do next?”

## Stabilising at different layers of “me”

You can stabilise at different levels of the me-stack.

### 1. Body-me

Sometimes the first stabilisation is very simple:

- feel the weight of the body,  
- feel contact with the ground or chair,  
- lengthen exhale a bit,  
- let shoulders drop,  
- look around the actual room.

This isn’t mystical. It’s:

- re-anchoring the **centre** of the field,  
- reminding the system it has a local, physical base.

You’re saying:

> “Whatever the stories and futures are,  
> there is a body here, now, that can be looked after a little.”

### 2. Values and preferences

Stabilising also means recalling:

- what *you* actually care about,  
- not just what you’ve been told to care about.

Questions like:

- “If I ignore how I’m supposed to be, what quietly matters to me here?”  
- “If I had to choose between being liked and being honest, which do I pick *this time*?”  
- “What kind of person am I trying to be in this specific situation?”

You’re giving the system a **local orientation**:

- not “my final life mission”,  
- just “in this tangle, this is the direction that fits me better.”

### 3. Boundaries

Stabilising often involves making or remembering **boundaries**:

- what you are and aren’t responsible for,  
- what you are and aren’t willing to tolerate,  
- what you will and won’t say yes to.

Boundary questions:

- “Is this actually mine to fix?”  
- “If this were happening to a friend, what would I think is reasonable for them?”  
- “What is the smallest line I can draw here that would already be a bit more honest?”

In the field, a boundary shows up as:

- a clearer edge between self and other,  
- a clearer “no” or “yes” in the body,  
- often some relief, even if it’s scary.

### 4. Narrative: “the I that is here now”

You can also stabilise at the level of story, but lightly:

- not “this is the final truth about me”,  
- more like “given everything so far, here’s a working self-description that feels more honest than the shame/anxiety/numbness version.”

For example:

- instead of “I am a failure”, something like:
  - “I’m someone who is overwhelmed here, but who cares and is trying to respond.”  

- instead of “I’m broken”, something like:
  - “I’m someone whose system is doing intense things to keep going, and I want to learn how to work with that.”

These are still compressions.  
They’re just less cruel ones that give you room to act.

## How stabilising feels

When stabilisation is working, even a little, you might notice:

- more sense of **“here-ness”**,  
- slightly **slower** inner speed,  
- clearer **“yes/no”** in small decisions,  
- a feeling of “standing in my own life” rather than floating.

The situation might still be painful.  
Nothing magical has been solved.

But the field has:

- a more solid centre,  
- a clearer orientation,  
- slightly less self-sabotaging narratives.

That’s often enough for:

- one email,  
- one boundary,  
- one conversation,  
- one tiny act of care.

## A simple stabilising script

This is not a ritual. It’s just a rough outline of how this move can look.

When you notice you’re in a hard state:

1. **Locate the body**  
   - Feel feet / seat / back.  
   - Look around the physical space.  
   - Name a few things you see.

2. **Name the feeling and the bind**  
   - “This feels like anxiety / shame / anger / numbness.”  
   - “The bind seems to be: if I do X, I’m Y; if I do not-X, I’m Z.”

3. **Remember what you care about here**  
   - “In this specific situation, what do I quietly care about most?”  
   - Honesty? Kindness? Self-respect? Safety? Curiosity?

4. **Draw one small boundary or orientation**  
   - “I am not responsible for [everything / their feelings / history].”  
   - “I will not pretend to be okay with X.”  
   - “I will at least not lie about Y to myself.”

5. **Choose one tiny next move**  
   - send a short message,  
   - write a few lines in a note,  
   - drink water,  
   - schedule a conversation,  
   - go outside for five minutes.

The size is not the point.  
The point is: the field reorients around a slightly clearer **“I, here, going this way.”**

## When stabilising goes wrong

Stabilising can also misfire. Common ways:

- **Over-rigidity**  
  - locking into “this is who I am and I must never change.”  
  - turning flexible preferences into absolute identity.

- **False self**  
  - stabilising around someone else’s values or expectations,  
  - using “I am this kind of person” to suppress inconvenient feelings.

- **Control frenzy**  
  - trying to stabilise everything at once: self, others, world, future, all under your thumb.

When that happens, the field often feels:

- brittle,  
- defensive,  
- easily shattered when reality doesn’t comply.

That’s where the **second move** comes in:  
sometimes what’s needed isn’t more structure, but more space.
