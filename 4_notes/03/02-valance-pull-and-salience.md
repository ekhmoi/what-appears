# Valence, Pull, and What Stands Out

In Part I we treated feeling as part of the basic picture of experience:

- not some extra layer on top of “real” perception,
- but a way the system **senses how well the current organisation is working from here**.

Roughly:

- when the way things are grouped and storied fits well enough,  
  the field can feel easy, flowing, or at least workable;

- when there’s a strong mismatch,  
  the field feels tense, brittle, chaotic, stuck.

This chapter just adds a bit more resolution to _how_ that shows up in the field, using three small handles:

- **valence** – pleasant / unpleasant / neutral feel-tone,
- **pull** – the way something seems to invite approach, avoidance, or stuckness,
- **what stands out** – what the system treats as important right now.

These aren’t new metaphysical objects. They’re just names for aspects of feeling you can already notice, and that make the “fit / mismatch” picture more concrete.

## Valence: how it basically feels

Right now, if you scan your experience, some parts are:

- **pleasant**

  - mild comfort, interest, warmth, ease.

- **unpleasant**

  - tension, pain, dread, irritation, shame, restlessness.

- basically **neutral**
  - the exact feel of your socks,
  - the shape of a random object in the corner,
  - ambient room details you’re not invested in.

This basic “pleasant / unpleasant / neutral” dimension is what I’ll call **valence**.

It shows up everywhere:

- in raw sensations (pain vs warmth),
- in emotion (joy vs shame),
- in mood (buoyant vs flat),
- even in thoughts (“nice idea” vs “ugh no, don’t think about that”).

Valence by itself doesn’t tell you much _why_ something feels that way.  
But it’s a simple, always-available channel of information about the system’s current read on its own organisation:

- **pleasant** often means: “the way I’m currently holding things is workable enough”,
- **unpleasant** often means: “something about how I’m holding this isn’t working, or feels unsafe”,
- **neutral** often means: “this doesn’t currently matter much for my projects / threats / cares”.

That’s not a law, just a rough phenomenological read.

## Pull: what this seems to want me to do

Feeling is rarely just a colour; it comes with **tendencies**.

If you watch closely, many feelings include a sense of:

- “move closer”,
- “get away”,
- “change this”,
- “don’t touch this”,
- “freeze and wait”.

That tendency is what I mean here by **pull**.

Examples:

- Remembering an unfinished task may bring:

  - slight stomach tension,
  - a thought like “I should really do that”,
  - and a **pull** towards “open the document / app / inbox”.

- Seeing a message from someone you’re scared of may bring:

  - jolt in the chest,
  - thought “later, not now”,
  - and a **pull** towards delaying, avoiding, hiding.

- Thinking of someone you love may bring:
  - warmth in the body,
  - a small smile,
  - and a **pull** towards texting them, remembering more, staying with the image.

From the “fit / mismatch” angle:

- when the current organisation gives you a **clear, safe-enough next move**, the pull can feel:

  - clean,
  - simple,
  - like “of course I’ll do X next”.

- when it **doesn’t**, pull often feels:
  - conflicting (“I want to reach out / I want to hide”),
  - stuck (“I should do something but I don’t know what”),
  - or collapsed (“there’s no point, nothing I do matters”).

One way of feeling anxiety is exactly this:

> a signal that the current way of grouping self, world, and time  
> doesn’t yield a clear or trustworthy next move from here.

Pull is being yanked in different directions at once, with no stable pattern the system wants to commit to.

## What stands out: feeling and structure

The field is already structured as figure/background, near/far, inside/outside.

On top of that, feeling adds another layer of **priority**.

Some things become **bright / loud / insistent**:

- they keep coming to mind,
- they grab attention even when you’re doing other stuff,
- they’re loaded with feeling.

Other things fade into **background**.

This “what stands out as important right now” isn’t separate from:

- your current projects and fears,
- your stories about what matters,
- your history.

It’s just the lived side of that.

Examples:

- In a crowded room, your own name spoken quietly can cut through a lot of noise.
- A small notification dot on an app can feel more important than half your visual field.
- A stray comment from someone you care about can sit at the front of your mind for days, while dozens of other events slide off.

From the field’s point of view:

- this is just **structure** again:
  - some patterns are held as more **central / near / figure**,
  - others as more **peripheral / far / background**.

Feeling (especially unpleasant feeling) is often what **pushes something into the centre**:

- pain,
- threat,
- perceived rejection,
- unresolved uncertainty.

So when you feel like:

> “This one thing is my whole life right now,”

what’s happening structurally is:

- a clump has become hugely **central** in the field,
- valence is likely skewing unpleasant,
- pull is conflicted or frozen.

Again, not a moral failure — just a description of a certain configuration.

## How this all ties back to fit / mismatch

Putting these threads together:

- **Valence** gives a quick read on how the current organisation feels from here:

  - workable / okay-ish,
  - or strained / unsafe / wrong.

- **Pull** shows how the system is trying to move:

  - towards,
  - away,
  - not at all.

- **What stands out** shows where the system has decided:
  - “This is central right now,”
  - often because it’s tied to survival, belonging, identity, or important projects.

When:

- valence is mostly okay,
- pull is reasonably clear,
- you’re not being hijacked by one or two hyper-central clumps,

the **felt sense** of the field is something like:

> “This is manageable. Not perfect, but I can see what’s going on and what to do next.”

When:

- valence is mostly unpleasant,
- pull is tangled or frozen,
- one or two issues dominate what stands out,

the **felt sense** is closer to:

> “The way I’m holding this doesn’t give me a way through.  
> I can’t find a safe or honest next move.”

That’s the territory where anxiety, shame, anger, numbness, etc. tend to show up in stronger, more confusing forms — and where Part III’s “stabilise / dissolve” moves will matter.

## A small in-field check

If you want to test this live, pause for a moment and:

1. Notice **one thing** that currently stands out in your field as important.

   - It might be this book,
   - or a person,
   - or a problem,
   - or a hope.

2. Sense into its **valence**:

   - pleasant, unpleasant, mixed, neutral?

3. Sense into the **pull**:

   - closer, away, fix, avoid, freeze, something else?

4. Finally, ask:
   - “Does the way I’m currently organising this give me a workable next move from here?”

No need to solve anything.  
This is just training the eye for how feeling:

- colours the field,
- tugs at action,
- and highlights where the current setup might not be fitting well.

In the next chapter, we’ll look at **uncertainty** and four familiar difficult states — anxiety, shame, anger, and numbness — as specific patterns in this same space, not as mysterious enemies.
