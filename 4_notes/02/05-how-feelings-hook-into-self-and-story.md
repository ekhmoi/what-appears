# How Feelings Hook Into Self and Story

By now we’ve got a few layers on the table:

From Part I:

- **field** – the whole situation of experience at once,
- **structure** – figure/background, near/far, inside/outside,
- **clumps** – “things”, projects, problems,
- **me-stack** – body-me, social-me, story-me, moral-me, system-me,
- **time/story** – before/now/after, and “I am someone who…”

From Part II:

- **sensation / emotion / mood**,
- **valence / pull / what stands out**,
- **uncertainty** as many live futures, no safe story,
- **anxiety / shame / anger / numbness** as particular configurations.

This chapter is about how those last ones plug into:

- the **me-stack**, and
- the **stories** you run about your life.

Not as abstract theory, but as “oh, this is how my field rearranges itself when this feeling hits.”

---

## Feelings as “votes” on who you are

When a strong feeling hits, it doesn’t just say:

- “this situation is good / bad.”

It often also says (implicitly):

- “**you** are this kind of person.”

For example:

- A wave of shame after a mistake:

  - doesn’t just say “that action was off”,
  - it often says “you are fundamentally a failure / liar / disappointment.”

- A wave of anger:

  - doesn’t just say “something wrong happened”,
  - it can say “you are the kind of person who has to fix everything”, or
  - “you are the righteous one in a world of idiots.”

- Numbness:
  - doesn’t just say “this is too much right now”,
  - it can say “you are someone who can’t feel / is broken / doesn’t really care.”

These are **self-compressions** being proposed by the system:

> “Given this feeling, maybe ‘I am someone who X’ is the right story.”

The feeling is not just a reaction.  
It’s also a **candidate update to your identity**.

## How anxiety hooks into self and time

From earlier:

> Anxiety = many live futures, no safe next move;  
> the current way of holding self/world/time doesn’t yield a trustworthy pattern.

Where does that land in the me-stack?

Commonly:

- **system-me** – the one who has to manage everything:

  - “I can’t see a way to handle this.”
  - “Whatever I choose will be wrong.”

- **story-me** – “I am someone who…”:

  - “If this goes badly, I’ll be the one who ruined things.”
  - “If I choose wrong, it proves I’m stupid / naive / selfish.”

- **moral-me** – good/bad, worthy/unworthy:
  - “A good person would know what to do here.”
  - “A competent adult wouldn’t be this stuck.”

In the field, that can look like:

- future-branches (time) playing out as different **self-stories**,
- each branch carrying its own emotional weight,
- none of them feeling survivable or coherent.

So anxiety isn’t just “I don’t know what will happen.”  
It’s:

> “I don’t know who I will be allowed to be in what happens,  
> and none of the candidates feel okay.”

## How shame hooks into social-me and moral-me

We glossed shame as:

> my self-story and this moment’s “reading” of me don’t match;  
> something about “me” feels exposed and wrong.

Two layers of the me-stack are especially lit up:

- **social-me** – how I appear to others:

  - “Now they see the real me.”
  - “They’ll think I’m disgusting / pathetic / ridiculous.”

- **moral-me** – good/bad, worthy/unworthy:
  - “Only a bad person would do this.”
  - “There is something fundamentally wrong with me.”

Shame often proposes very strong identity statements:

- “I am someone who betrays people.”
- “I am someone who can’t be trusted.”
- “I am someone who is never enough.”

These compress:

- many events,
- plus current feeling,
- into a single heavy self-clump.

They also reach into time:

- **past**: retelling old events to fit the “I am bad” story,
- **future**: predicting more of the same,
- **now**: reading this moment as proof.

In that configuration, it’s easy to miss that:

- shame is a **move** the system is making,
- not an objective scan of your soul.

## How anger hooks into boundaries and agency

We read anger as:

> something about how things are arranged feels wrong or violating;  
> energy surges to redraw a boundary or change a pattern.

Anger tends to plug into:

- **story-me**:

  - “I am someone who doesn’t tolerate this.”
  - “I am someone who stands up / protects / fights back.”

- **moral-me**:

  - “This is unjust.”
  - “They are violating what’s right.”

- **system-me / agent-me**:
  - “I am the one who has to fix this.”
  - “If I don’t push back, no-one will.”

Anger reaches into time by:

- replaying past slights and injustices,
- extrapolating futures where this keeps happening,
- aiming at a future where things are different.

When it’s grounded, anger can be:

- “this boundary, not this person, needs to change”,
- “this pattern is not okay, I need to act.”

When it clumps too hard, it can turn into:

- “these people are simply bad, I am simply right”,
- “my only identity here is ‘righteous fighter’.”

Either way, it’s reorganising:

- who you are allowed to be,
- what the world is like,
- what stories are acceptable.

## How numbness hooks into story and horizon

We framed numbness as:

> the system judges that feeling this would be too much to handle right now,  
> so it turns down the volume on experience.

That move can attach to:

- **story-me**:

  - “I am someone who doesn’t really feel.”
  - “I’m numb / broken / checked out.”

- **time / horizon**:

  - the future can collapse into:
    - “more of the same grey”,
    - or “blank”,
    - or “doesn’t matter.”

- **system-me**:
  - “I can’t afford to feel this, I wouldn’t be able to function.”
  - “My job is to keep the lights on, not to feel.”

In the field, numbness often flattens:

- differences between situations,
- difference between days,
- difference between versions of you.

Everything compresses into:

- “it’s all just… this”,
- with very low resolution.

That can make it harder to imagine any story where:

- you change,
- the world responds differently,
- anything feels vivid again.

Which in turn reinforces the numb identity:

- “this is just what I am now.”

## Feelings as story-selectors

From a certain angle, strong feelings are:

> **story-selectors** – they bias which self/world/future compressions get activated.

For example:

- Anxiety tends to amplify stories like:

  - “I’m someone who must not make mistakes.”
  - “I’m responsible for everyone’s outcomes.”
  - “If I choose wrong once, I ruin everything.”

- Shame tends to amplify:

  - “I’m fundamentally bad / disgusting / unlovable.”
  - “If people see the real me, they’ll leave.”
  - “Any flaw reveals the whole rotten core.”

- Anger tends to amplify:

  - “I see the truth and others are blind / malicious.”
  - “I must be the one who stops this.”
  - “If I soften, I’ll be crushed.”

- Numbness tends to amplify:
  - “Nothing will really change.”
  - “I’m not the kind of person who gets good things.”
  - “Caring is dangerous or pointless.”

None of these are neutral descriptions.  
They are **compressed narratives** that:

- highlight some facts,
- ignore others,
- and shape what actions even feel possible.

---

## A small mapping exercise

If you want to see this live, pick a recent moment where one of these states was strong.

- anxiety,
- shame,
- anger,
- or numbness.

Then:

1. Recall the moment just enough to feel a trace of it again.
2. Ask:
   - Which layers of **me** lit up?
     - body-me, social-me, story-me, moral-me, system-me?
   - What sentence did it suggest:
     - “I am someone who…”?
   - How did it treat **time**?
     - past: what did it highlight?
     - future: what did it predict?
3. See if you can write (just for yourself) the **short story** that this feeling was trying to install.

For example:

- “In that shame spike, the story was:  
  _I am someone who always lets people down, and they will eventually leave when they see the real me._”

or:

- “In that anger, the story was:  
  _I am the only sane one in a world of idiots, and it’s my job to fix everything._”

You don’t have to argue with the story yet.  
We’re just making its shape visible.

## Why this matters for what comes next

Part III will be about **working with difficulty**:

- noticing what a feeling is pointing at,
- and responding in ways that don’t just reinforce the tightest, harshest stories.

If you don’t see how feelings hook into self and story, it’s easy to get trapped in:

- “I feel this, therefore this story is true, therefore I should feel this.”

If you _do_ see the hooks, you get a bit more room:

- “Oh, this shame is trying to install the ‘I am fundamentally broken’ story again.”
- “This anxiety is trying to convince me I need a perfect move or I’ll be ruined.”
- “This numbness is treating all future possibilities as identical grey.”

From there, you can:

- stabilise the parts of “me” that actually need care,
- loosen or rewrite compressions that are too coarse,
- and gradually give the field more ways to organise itself than just these four emergency modes.

We’ll take that up next.

For now, the key takeaway is:

> Difficult feelings don’t just hurt.  
> They also **propose identities and stories**.  
> Seeing those proposals clearly is already a form of freedom.
