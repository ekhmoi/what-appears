2. New rule: show, don’t sermonise

Your own line nails it:

“If you don’t want to come across as a guy with a capital-T Teaching…
don’t talk like a guy with a capital-T Teaching.
Just show the tools. Trust the reader.”

So in editing, anytime the book is:

talking about itself (“not a religion”, “don’t worship this”, “this framework is very powerful”)
instead of

talking about experience / tools

…that’s probably a candidate for cutting or shrinking.

Replace “meta about the teaching” with “here’s something to notice / try”.
