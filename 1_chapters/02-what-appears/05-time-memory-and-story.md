## Time, Memory, and “My Life” as They Appear

So far we’ve mostly looked at what’s present:

- the current field,
- its structure,
- things and clumps,
- here/body/me.

But your experience is not just a frozen snapshot.

There’s also:

- **“before”** – what has happened,
- **“after”** – what might happen,
- a sense of **flow** – this is going somewhere.

In this chapter we’ll look at:

- how **time** appears in the field,
- how **memory** and **expectation** show up,
- how they knit together into a **story**: “my life”.

We’re staying close to appearance, not doing physics or neuroscience.

### Before / now / after in the field

---

Right now, see if you can notice three different flavours:

1. **Now**

   - Sensations, sounds, visuals, thoughts that feel like they are “presently happening”.

2. **Before**

   - Images, stories, bodily echoes that are tagged as “earlier than now”.

3. **After**
   - Scenarios, plans, fears, hopes tagged as “later than now”.

All three can be active **at the same time**.

For example, while reading this you might also be:

- remembering a conversation from this morning, and
- anticipating an email you need to send later.

In appearance, “before” and “after” aren’t somewhere else.  
They’re **right here**, as contents of the current field:

- as images,
- as inner speech,
- as bodily feelings,
- as knowing.

Time, as we live it, is not just numbers on a clock.  
It’s this pattern of:

> different bits of the field carrying **“earlier / now / later” tags**.

---

### Memory as something that appears now

---

Pick a simple recent event: what you had for your last meal, or where you woke up this morning.

Let that memory come up for a moment.

Notice:

- maybe a visual image,
- maybe a vague sense of the space,
- maybe a few words,
- maybe a taste or smell echo.

Whatever shows up is not **the past itself**.  
It’s a **present appearance** tagged as “about the past”.

Most of the time we look straight through that and talk as if:

- “the past is behind me, fixed, out there somewhere.”

But in terms of what appears:

- “the past” is a **pattern of current memories**, sitting in the now-field.

This doesn’t mean “nothing really happened”. It just means:

> when we talk about “my past”, we’re always talking from **inside the present field**, using current appearances as pointers.

This becomes important later when we touch trauma and old stories.  
For now, just notice the basic fact.

---

### Expectation and imagined futures

---

Do the same with the future.

Pick something that’s coming up: a meeting, a date, a call, a trip.

Let the sense of that future moment appear:

- maybe images,
- predicted words,
- a sense of dread or excitement in the body,
- a general felt “shape” of how it will go.

Again:

- This is not “the future itself”.
- It’s a **present appearance** tagged as “about later”.

Expectation and prediction live **in the now-field** as:

- imagined scenes,
- feelings of openness / threat / opportunity,
- action tendencies (“I should prepare”, “I want to avoid this”).

From the inside, it often feels like:

> “The future is coming towards me.”

From the perspective of appearance:

> “Images and feelings about later are arising now, shaping how I move.”

---

### Flow and continuity

---

If you track just a short slice — say the last five minutes — there’s also a sense of **flow**:

- You weren’t always in this exact state.
- Something led to you reading this.
- Something will follow it.

This **continuity-feel** is part of how “time” shows up.

It comes from multiple sources:

- remembered steps (open browser → click link → start reading),
- sense of momentum (“I’m in the middle of my day”),
- background expectations (“after this I’ll do X”).

All of that is yet another **clump**:

> a small segment of life treated as one flowing unit.

Zoom out and you get:

- “this morning”,
- “this week”,
- “this year”,
- “my childhood”,
- “my twenties”,
- “my life so far”.

Each of those is a big clump of many moments, represented now by a few compressed pointers.

---

### From time to story: “I am someone who…”

---

Take the sense of:

- a “me” (from the last chapter), and
- a flow of “before / now / after”,

and put them together.

You get:

> **story** – a narrative about what kind of someone you are, moving through time.

Examples:

- “I am someone who always messes things up in the end.”
- “I am someone who escaped.”
- “I am someone who disappoints people.”
- “I am someone who survives.”
- “I am someone who used to be religious, then rebelled, then found my own path.”

These sentences are not just abstract beliefs. They are:

- compressed summaries of many memories,
- bound to emotional tones in the body,
- shaping expectations about the future.

In the field, they show up as:

- inner speech,
- images,
- bodily feels,
- immediate interpretations of what happens.

For example:

- If your story is “I screw things up”, a small mistake can instantly light up a whole **story-clump**:
  - memories of past failures,
  - shame in the body,
  - predictions of future disaster.

That story is a **big compression**:

> many details → one heavy “thing”: _“me, the screw-up.”_

---

### Stories as lenses, not just records

---

An important point:

Stories don’t just **describe** life. They also **filter and select** it.

Given hundreds of events, your system can:

- pick out the ones that fit the current story,
- downplay or forget the rest,
- slightly rewrite memories to be more consistent.

So “I am someone who X” is not a neutral summary. It’s a **lens** that:

- highlights some parts of the field (as evidence),
- dims others (as irrelevant or mistakes).

This is not a personal failing. It’s how finite systems manage complexity.  
But it means that:

- stories can get **stuck**,
- and feel more solid than the underlying data really warrants.

We’ll dig into this more when we talk about difficult feelings and uncertainty.

---

### A tiny story-inspection

---

If you feel up for it, try this very lightly.

Finish the sentence in your head:

> “I am someone who…”

Let the first few completions come. Don’t censor.

Notice:

- which one feels emotionally charged,
- what memories or images pop up with it,
- what body sensations go with it,
- what future expectations it carries.

Then ask, just as a question:

- What doesn’t fit this story?
- What moments go _against_ it that I tend to ignore?

You don’t have to change the story right now.  
We’re just noticing that:

- the “life-story” is a **compression**,
- sitting in the field as a present appearance,
- shaping what counts as real for you.

### Where we are so far

---

Let’s recap what Part I has given us up to this point:

- A **field** – the whole situation of experience at once.
- **Structure** – figure/background, near/far, centre/periphery, inside/outside.
- **Clumping** – how “things” appear as units (objects, projects, problems).
- **Here / body / proto-me** – a centre and a stacked “I” built around this body and its history.
- **Time / memory / expectation / story** – how “before / now / after” and “I am someone who…” show up in the field.

We still haven’t decided what ultimately exists.  
We’ve just mapped how things **appear** from the inside.

This is the base layer for everything else in the book:

- In Part II, we’ll bring **feelings** into this picture.
- In Part III, we’ll talk about **difficulty** and **responses**.
- In Part IV, we’ll propose an **architecture** that ties it all together.

Before we move on to feelings, we’ll do a short recap chapter to pull Part I into one compact view.
