# Part 0 - Orientation  
*Where This Is Coming From*

I didn’t start here because I was curious about consciousness.

I started here because my life wouldn’t fit the story it was given.

I grew up in a strict Muslim family. God, morality, gender, the future — all of it arrived pre-labelled:

- This is right.  
- This is wrong.  
- This is who you are.  

Inside that, there wasn’t much slack.

At the same time, I was attracted to men.

I didn’t have theory for it. It was just a simple, persistent fact in my experience. A pull. A way my body and feelings oriented around certain people. And it clashed hard with the story I’d been handed.

If I borrow language from later in the book: the “compressions” I had around self, gender, and morality didn’t match what was actually showing up in my field of experience. Story said one thing. Life said another.

You can’t live like that forever without something breaking.

My first fix was to burn the story down.

If the official picture says I’m wrong, and I can’t stop being what I am, maybe the picture is wrong. So I swung into atheism and “be rational, don’t be fooled again.”

That move gave me:

- A way to say “no” to a structure that was crushing me.  
- A sense of integrity: I’d rather be honest and damned than obedient and fake.  
- A simpler world: no God, no sin, just matter, brains, and social games.

In the language I’ll use later: that was a **stabilising move**. I tightened around a new “I” and a new world-model that felt more trustworthy. It worked — up to a point.

Even inside that flat, atheist frame, some things wouldn’t stay flat.  
Moments in nature, music, connection, intense emotion — they felt *bigger* than “atoms and social conditioning”. Not as proofs of God, just as data my map didn’t really explain.

Then came LSD and mushrooms.

I’m not selling them as an answer. But they did blow holes in my maps:
- The usual “me” went weirdly transparent or rearranged.  
- Reality felt more fluid and constructed than I’d thought.  
- There was a wide, non-personal clarity that didn’t fit my current story.


They didn’t hand me a new religion. They did something more annoying: they made it impossible to fully believe the old *or* the new story.

I couldn’t go back to a personal, mythic God handing down rules.  
I couldn’t fully believe in a flat, emotionally antiseptic materialism either.

Meanwhile, my day job is software engineering / architecture. My brain is trained to think in terms of:

- systems and layers,  
- interfaces and invariants,  
- messy reality compressed into something usable.

So while all this was happening — religion cracking, atheism cracking, altered states happening — there was also this very nerdy background process running:

> What’s the *architecture* here?  
> How is experience wired?  
> What’s stable? What’s an implementation detail?

I didn’t want a new spiritual “app”. I wanted to understand the runtime.

This book comes out of that mix:  
a queer ex-Muslim, ex-atheist software architect trying to write one semi-sane systems doc for lived experience, after several failed designs.

At some point I stopped asking:

> “What is ultimately real?”

and started asking:

> “What is **appearing, right now**, and how is it organised?”

Not as metaphysics. Just as a way to stop fighting my own experience and to understand why certain patterns of suffering kept repeating.

This book is my current best answer to that question.
