# Working With Difficulty Inside Experience

So far we’ve mostly mapped the terrain:

- Part I: **what appears** – field, structure, clumps, self, time, story.
- Part II: **how feelings appear** – sensation, emotion, mood, uncertainty, anxiety/shame/anger/numbness, and how they hook into self and story.

Now we switch emphasis from **description** to **moves**.

Not:

- external techniques to apply _to_ yourself from the outside,
- or one magic trick to fix everything,

but:

> ways the field can **reorganise itself from the inside**  
> when it finds itself in painful, stuck, or confusing configurations.

We’ll look at three layers:

1. **What difficult feelings point to**  
   – what they’re saying about the current organisation of self/world/time/story.

2. **Two basic moves** the system can make:

   - **stabilising** around a trustworthy “I”,
   - **dissolving** overly tight clumps and splits.
   
3. **Protocols and examples**  
   - simple rules like honesty and humility that shape how the story of “me” is generated,  
   - concrete scenarios that show how stabilising and dissolving can weave together in real life,  
   - including how all of this plays out **with other humans**, not just inside your own head.


Important:

- I’m not giving you commandments.
- I’m not saying “always stabilise” or “always dissolve”.
- I’m not saying you should be able to do any of this perfectly.

Think of this part as:

> a library of **possible reorganisations**  
> that you can experiment with from inside your own field.

You already make both moves, all the time.  
Part III just makes them more conscious, so you can lean on them when things get intense instead of defaulting to the harshest habits.
