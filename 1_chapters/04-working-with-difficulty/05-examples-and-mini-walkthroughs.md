## Examples and Mini Walkthroughs

To keep this from staying theoretical, here are a few simple scenarios.

They’re not meant to cover every situation.  
They’re just examples of:

- noticing a difficult configuration in the field,
- sensing what it points to,
- trying stabilise / dissolve moves,
- seeing how they can weave.

---

### 1. Anxiety about a choice

---

**Situation:**  
You’ve been offered a job in another city. If you take it, you leave your current life. If you don’t, you’re afraid you’ll stay stuck.

### How it appears

- Body: restlessness, tight chest, pacing.
- Attention: flips between pros/cons lists, outcome simulations.
- Thoughts: “what if I regret this forever?”, “what if I miss my one chance?”, “what if I’m making a huge mistake?”

You can name it:

- “This feels like anxiety + loaded uncertainty.”
- “The bind: if I go, I might blow up my life; if I stay, I might waste it.”

### What it’s pointing at

- self ↔ future: “who will I be in each branch?”
- story-me: “am I someone who takes risks or someone who stays loyal?”
- system-me: “I must choose perfectly or be ruined.”

No wonder the field can’t find a safe move.

### Move One – stabilise

- Body:
  - sit down, feel weight, look around the actual room.
- Values:
  - “For me, in this season, what matters more:
    - adventure and growth,
    - or continuity and depth?”
- Boundaries:
  - “This one decision does **not** have to carry the entire weight of my worth.”
- Tiny move:
  - set a specific time to decide,
  - or schedule conversations with two trusted people,
  - or write out what “regret” actually means here.

The field gets:

- a clearer sense of “I here, caring about X and Y”,
- some containment for the decision.

### Move Two – dissolve (a bit later)

- De-clump:
  - instead of “my whole life”, see:
    - work life,
    - social life,
    - inner life,
      as partially separable.
- Soften story:
  - notice the “one mistake ruins everything” compression.
  - ask: “Has that literally been true in my past?”
- De-centre:
  - consider that many people make non-optimal choices and still live meaningful lives.

The field gets:

- more than one acceptable story:
  - “I’m someone who tried something, learned, adjusted,”
  - in multiple branches.

The choice may still be hard, but it’s less like walking a tightrope over the void.

### 2. Shame after saying something harsh

---

**Situation:**  
You snapped at a friend and said something that felt too cruel. Now you’re replaying it.

### How it appears

- Body: heaviness, heat in the face, urge to curl in.
- Attention: looping the moment, zooming in on their expression.
- Thoughts: “I’m a terrible person”, “this is who I really am”, “they’ll never trust me again.”

You can name it:

- “Shame, focused on social-me and moral-me.”
- “The story: I am fundamentally bad and now exposed.”

### What it’s pointing at

- your value of not wanting to hurt people,
- a real mismatch between how you want to show up and how you did,
- fear about relationship and self-image.

So shame is at least partly tracking:  
“I crossed my own line here.”

### Move One – stabilise

- Body:
  - feel the ground, lengthen exhale a bit, put a hand somewhere that hurts.
- Values:
  - “I do, in fact, care about how I treat people.”
- Narrative:
  - gently adjust from “I am awful” to  
    “I’m someone who did something that doesn’t match my values and feels pain about that.”
- Tiny move:
  - write a draft apology,
  - or plan a repair conversation,
  - or talk to a third party you trust to reality-check.

Now the field includes:

- a caring “I” who wants to repair,
- not just a condemned sinner.

### Move Two – dissolve

- De-clump:
  - separate:
    - this specific moment,
    - your overall character,
    - other evidence of how you usually act.
- Question absolutes:
  - “Is this really the sole revelation of my ‘true self’, or one revealing but not total episode?”
- De-centre:
  - see how stress, context, the other person’s part, history, etc., contributed.

The purpose is **not** to excuse everything.  
It’s to loosen “this proves I am trash” into:

- “this shows something about my patterns, which I can work with.”

Shame becomes:

- a pointer toward change,
- not a permanent identity verdict.

### 3. Numbness in a long rough patch

---

**Situation:**  
Life has been hard for a while. You notice you don’t feel much about things that used to matter.

### How it appears

- Body: dullness, tiredness, low energy.
- Attention: sliding off meaningful topics, defaulting to distraction.
- Thoughts: “I don’t care”, “nothing matters”, or nothing very articulate at all.

You can name it:

- “Numbness / flattening.”
- “The story: this is just how I am now.”

### What it’s pointing at

- long-term overload,
- a sense that feeling fully would be too much,
- a protective move: “turn down the volume so we can keep functioning.”

### Move One – stabilise

Here stabilising is mostly about **care** and **containment**:

- Body:
  - basic rhythms: food, sleep, daylight, small movement.
- Values:
  - tiny sparks: “Is there _anything_ that still feels even 2% interesting or less awful?”
- Boundaries:
  - “I don’t have to solve my whole life right now. Surviving this month is enough.”

Tiny moves:

- extremely small acts that signal “I still exist and matter a bit”:
  - answering one message,
  - taking a shower,
  - going outside for five minutes,
  - doing one small thing you used to enjoy, even if it feels flat.

You’re saying:

> “Even if I feel nothing, this life is still under my care.”

### Move Two – dissolve (gently, slowly)

- De-clump:
  - notice how “nothing ever changes” is a compression:
    - can you find _any_ exceptions, however minor?
- Soften the identity:
  - “Maybe ‘I am numb’ is more like:  
     ‘my system is protecting itself in a blunt way right now.’”
- Widen horizon slightly:
  - imagine futures where this state is _part_ of your story, not the whole of it.

The aim is not to blow open the doors.  
It’s to gently remind the system that:

- this configuration is a **move**,
- not the only possible mode.

---

### 4. Anger at being mistreated

---

**Situation:**  
Someone keeps crossing a line (talking over you, criticising harshly, dismissing your needs). Anger flares.

### How it appears

- Body: heat, tension, a sense of “pushing against”.
- Attention: locked on their behaviour, past examples.
- Thoughts: “How dare they”, “I’m done with this”, “they never respect me.”

Name it:

- “Anger about a repeated boundary violation.”
- “There’s a sense that something about this pattern is not okay.”

### What it’s pointing at

- your values around respect and dignity,
- a possible mismatch between your current boundaries and how you’re being treated,
- a need for the pattern to change.

### Move One – stabilise

- Body:
  - feel the energy in the body without immediately acting it out.
- Values:
  - “In relationships, I care about mutual respect, being heard, safety.”
- Boundaries:
  - “This pattern — [name it specifically] — is not okay with me.”
- Tiny move:
  - write down concrete examples,
  - talk to a trusted third party,
  - prepare to name the behaviour clearly.

You’re clarifying:

- “I, here, am someone for whom this is not acceptable.”

### Move Two – dissolve

- De-clump:
  - separate:
    - this person,
    - this pattern,
    - your own contributions,
    - old echoes from earlier relationships.
- Loosen “they are just bad”:
  - not necessarily to excuse them,
  - but to see more options than fight or cut-off.
- See yourself as more than “the angry one”:
  - include your hurt, fear, wish for connection, etc.

This opens more possible responses:

- clear conversation,
- restructure the relationship,
- leaving,
- or, in some cases, genuinely letting go.

The point is not to become less honest.  
It’s to become **less trapped** in only one story of “me vs them”.

These are sketches, not scripts.

The hope is just that you can start to see:

- how stabilising and dissolving moves show up naturally,
- and how you can lean into them deliberately when things are tight.

The last chapter of this part will talk about staying oriented when things get especially weird or intense.
