## Chapter 4 - Anxiety, Shame, Anger, and Numbness in the Field

We’ve talked about:

- sensation, emotion, mood,
- valence, pull, what stands out,
- uncertainty as “many futures alive, no safe story”.

Now we’ll look at four very common difficult states:

- **anxiety**,
- **shame**,
- **anger**,
- **numbness**,

as **ways the field can organise itself** when the current setup isn’t working.

This won’t be a full psychology of any of them.  
Just a sketch of what they’re like from inside this lens.

---

### Anxiety: “no safe next move”

---

A simple phenomenological read of anxiety is:

> **too many live possibilities;  
> the current way I’m holding things doesn’t yield a safe or clear next move from here.**

In the field, anxiety often looks like:

- **Body**

  - jittery energy, or buzzing in limbs,
  - tight chest / gut,
  - shallow or held breath.

- **Attention**

  - scanning for more information,
  - looping over the same few scenarios,
  - trouble settling on anything.

- **Thoughts**

  - “what if… what if… what if…”,
  - rehearsing disasters,
  - trying to find the one perfect move.

- **Pull**
  - urge to act _and_ urge to avoid, at the same time,
  - start/stop impulses,
  - difficulty committing to anything.

Structurally:

- there are many competing compressions of self/world/future,
- none of them feels safe or honest enough,
- the “me” clump is heavily involved (“if this happens, what does that make me?”).

So the field sits in:

- high **uncertainty**,
- high **stake**,
- high **activation**,
- low **trust in any available story**.

Anxiety is not just “an emotion” in the air.  
It’s the felt side of:

> “This configuration doesn’t give me a believable way forward.”

---

### Shame: “my story and this moment don’t match”

---

A simple read of shame:

> **the way I see myself, and the way this situation seems to “read” me, don’t match;  
> something about “me” feels exposed and wrong.**

In the field, shame often shows up as:

- **Body**

  - collapsing posture, wanting to curl in,
  - heat in the face or chest,
  - heaviness, urge to hide.

- **Attention**

  - fixation on how others see you (real or imagined),
  - replaying moments of exposure,
  - narrowing around the “awful thing”.

- **Thoughts**

  - “I am bad / disgusting / unlovable / broken”,
  - “they see the real me now”,
  - harsh internal commentary.

- **Pull**
  - urge to disappear, avoid, apologise excessively, over-correct,
  - sometimes urge to attack or blame outward to escape the burn.

Structurally:

- **social-me** and **moral-me** are under attack,
- a story of “what kind of person I am” gets clobbered by this event,
- the field organises around a single hyper-central clump:
  - the mistake,
  - the flaw,
  - the exposure.

The feel is:

- “I, as a whole, am not okay”, not just “something I did was off”.

Shame often rides on a very tight and unforgiving compression of self:

- small deviations → total verdict.

---

### Anger: “this is wrong; a boundary or pattern must change”

---

A simple read of anger:

> **something about how things are organised here feels wrong or violating;  
> energy surges to redraw a boundary or change a pattern.**

In the field, anger often looks like:

- **Body**

  - heat, tension, readiness in arms / jaw,
  - expansion in the chest, rising energy.

- **Attention**

  - locking onto the offending person / situation,
  - tracking evidence of wrongness,
  - less sensitivity to nuance.

- **Thoughts**

  - “how dare they”,
  - “this is not okay”,
  - “I won’t let this stand”.

- **Pull**
  - move towards to confront,
  - or away to cut off,
  - or to plan future action.

Structurally:

- a particular pattern in the field is tagged as **intolerable** under your current values,
- the system tries to **reorganise the field**:
  - assert a boundary,
  - change behaviour (yours or others),
  - withdraw resources.

Anger can be destructive, but in this lens it’s not automatically a bug.  
It’s often a signal that:

- your current organisation of self/world includes values and boundaries,
- something is hitting against those,
- energy is mobilising to reconfigure the situation.

It becomes a problem when:

- the clumps are too coarse (“they are entirely evil; I am entirely right”),
- or when it gets stuck without any workable action.

---

### Numbness: “too much; shut it down”

---

A simple read of numbness:

> **the system judges that feeling this would be too much to handle right now,  
> so it turns down the volume on experience.**

In the field, numbness can look like:

- **Body**

  - dullness, lack of sensation,
  - or a distant, cotton-wrapped feel.

- **Attention**

  - difficulty caring,
  - sliding off topics that would usually matter,
  - blankness where there might be emotion.

- **Thoughts**

  - “whatever”,
  - “I don’t know”,
  - sometimes nothing much at all.

- **Pull**
  - towards distraction,
  - towards sleep,
  - towards mechanical action without engagement.

Structurally:

- there may be **too many painful clumps** active at once,
- or one huge clump that feels unfaceable,
- the system chooses to **lower granularity**:
  - fewer distinctions,
  - less contact,
  - less local detail.

It’s a kind of emergency compression:

- “make this whole region of the field less detailed so it hurts less.”

This can be life-preserving in some contexts.  
It becomes a problem when:

- it persists long after the acute threat,
- it blocks any possibility of reorganisation,
- the system forgets that this is a move it’s making, not an unchangeable fact.

### These are configurations, not verdicts

---

Seen through this lens:

- anxiety,
- shame,
- anger,
- numbness,

are not random invaders or moral failings.  
They are **ways the field organises itself** under stress:

- anxiety → many futures, no safe story, high activation, stuck pull,
- shame → self-story vs situation clash, self treated as wrong as a whole,
- anger → perceived wrongness, energy to redraw boundaries or change patterns,
- numbness → perceived overload, shutting down detail and contact.

This doesn’t make them pleasant.  
It just gives you another position to stand in:

> instead of “I am anxious / ashamed / angry / numb, therefore I am bad or doomed”,  
> you can start to see:  
> “The system is in this particular configuration right now.”

From there, Part III will have more room to work:

- sometimes the move will be to **stabilise**:

  - clarify self, values, boundaries,
  - find a story that can carry you through.

- sometimes the move will be to **dissolve**:
  - soften clumps,
  - widen the field,
  - loosen tight identifications.

Before we go there, the next chapter will connect these difficult states more explicitly to:

- the “me” stack,
- time and story,

so you can see how they hook into identity and narrative in practice.
