## Uncertainty as a Felt Texture

So far we’ve talked about:

- feelings as part of the field,
- basic feel-tone (valence),
- how feeling comes with pulls and priorities.

Now we’ll zoom in on one particular kind of feel that shows up _everywhere_ in modern life:

> **uncertainty** – not as an abstract idea,  
> but as a **texture** in experience.

We’ll look at:

- what it’s like when many futures are alive at once,
- how that shows up in the body and attention,
- how it interacts with the “me” and “story” we met in Part I.

### Many possible compressions, none landed

---

From the “architecture” side of this lens:

- the field is always in the process of **compressing**:
  - grouping,
  - simplifying,
  - landing on a more stable pattern.

When things are relatively clear:

- one way of grouping the situation stands out as **“how it is”**,
- you get a sense of **“okay, that’s the story for now”**,
- and usually, a **next move** suggests itself.

When you’re uncertain, something else is happening:

- there are **many possible compressions** of the current situation,
- none of them feels solid enough to commit to,
- the field hasn’t “collapsed” into a single stable story.

In world-terms, that might look like:

- several possible outcomes,
- several ways to interpret what’s happening,
- several identities you could inhabit here.

In experience, this shows up as:

- open loops,
- “what if” branches,
- fuzziness where you want clarity.

---

### How uncertainty feels in the field

---

Let’s make this concrete.

Think of a situation in your life right now where you genuinely **don’t know** how it will go:

- a relationship you’re not sure about,
- a job possibility,
- a health thing,
- a move,
- a message you haven’t sent yet.

Let it come into your field, then notice:

- **Body**

  - restless energy, or dull heaviness,
  - tightness in the chest or gut,
  - shallow breathing, or a held breath,
  - urge to pace, scroll, refresh.

- **Attention**

  - scanning for more data,
  - replaying the same few facts,
  - jumping into imagined conversations and scenes,
  - difficulty staying with other tasks.

- **Thoughts**

  - branching “if this, then that, but then…” trees,
  - attempts to simulate multiple futures,
  - self-questions (“what if I’m wrong?”, “what if I miss my chance?”).

- **Overall feel**
  - not quite here,
  - slightly ahead of yourself,
  - unsettled, incomplete.

None of that is just “in your head”. It’s a **configuration of the whole field**.

---

### Uncertainty vs simple “not knowing”

---

It’s useful to distinguish at least two flavours:

1. **Simple “don’t know, don’t care much”**

   - You don’t know how many leaves are currently on a tree in another country.
   - You don’t know what your neighbour ate for breakfast.
   - And… that’s fine.

   The system doesn’t light up around these. There’s no big pull, because:

   - they’re not tied to your projects,
   - they’re not tied to your threats,
   - they don’t matter much for your self-story.

   This kind of not-knowing is easy, almost invisible.

2. **Loaded uncertainty**

   - You don’t know if someone you care about will stay.
   - You don’t know if you’ll lose your job.
   - You don’t know if you’ll regret a major decision.

   Here, the system _does_ light up, because:

   - different outcomes compress into very different **stories of you**,
   - some outcomes feel threatening to your basic sense of okayness,
   - you can’t find a stable way to group it all that gives a good next move.

   This kind of not-knowing is **felt**:  
   it has weight, friction, sometimes panic.

In this part of the book, when I say **uncertainty**, I mostly mean the second kind.

### Uncertainty and the “me” stack

---

From Part I, recall some layers of “me”:

- **social-me** – how you appear to others,
- **story-me** – “I am someone who…”,
- **moral-me** – good/bad, worthy/unworthy,
- **system-me** – the one who has to manage it all.

Uncertainty is usually intense when:

- different future compressions give very different fates for one or more of these.

For example:

- “If I leave this relationship, maybe I become ‘someone who abandons people’.  
  If I stay, maybe I become ‘someone who betrays himself’.”

- “If I take this job, I’m ‘someone who sold out’.  
  If I don’t, I’m ‘someone who chickened out and stayed stuck’.”

So the system isn’t just choosing between **external outcomes**.  
It’s choosing between **competing self-stories**.

That’s why uncertainty can feel so personal and so loaded:

> it’s not just “what will happen”,  
> it’s “who am I allowed to be on the other side of this?”

---

### Open loops and the sense of “no safe move”

---

Another way uncertainty feels is as **open loops**:

- questions that don’t settle,
- actions that don’t feel safe enough to take,
- no move that doesn’t violate some value or story.

If you listen for it, there can be a low-level message like:

> “Whatever I do, something important will break,  
> and I don’t have a story that makes that survivable.”

This is very close to the shape of **anxiety** we’ll talk about in the next chapter:

- many possible compressions,
- no trusted one,
- “me” and “future” tangled up in each of them.

The felt sense is something like:

- leaning over a gap,
- no solid ground to push off from,
- trying to walk on half-built bridges.

---

### When uncertainty is okay

---

Not all uncertainty hurts.

Sometimes:

- the unknown is spacious,
- multiple possibilities feel like **options**, not threats,
- there’s room to explore.

Experientially, that can feel like:

- curiosity,
- lightness,
- play,
- “let’s see what happens”.

What’s different there?

Roughly:

- The current “me” feels **robust enough**:

  - several futures are compatible with “I can still be me and be basically okay”.

- The system doesn’t need to lock in one specific story to feel safe.

So uncertainty isn’t the enemy by itself.  
What hurts is usually:

- **high-stakes uncertainty** around identity, belonging, and basic okayness,
- combined with no way to find a story that can hold the possible outcomes.

---

### A light exploration

---

If you want to check some of this in your own field:

1. Bring to mind a situation where you feel **loaded uncertainty**.

   - Not the most traumatic thing; just something real.

2. Notice:

   - Body: what happens in chest, gut, breath, shoulders?
   - Attention: scanning? avoiding? looping?
   - Thoughts: what are the main “what if” branches?

3. Then ask:
   - “What are the **self-stories** attached to the different outcomes?”
   - “Who do I become in each branch?”

You don’t have to resolve anything.  
We’re just getting a feel for uncertainty as:

> the field holding **multiple incompatible compressions** of self/world/future,  
> with no settled place to stand — yet.

In the next chapter, we’ll look at how this shows up as more specific difficult states:

- anxiety,
- shame,
- anger,
- numbness.

All as **patterns in the field**, not as mysterious foreign objects.
