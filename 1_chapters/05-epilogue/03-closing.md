## Closing

If you’ve reached this page, you’ve been walking inside my head for a while.

Not just the cleaned-up parts:

- also the bits shaped by strict religion,
- rebellion and atheism,
- queer desire in a frame that didn’t allow it,
- shortcuts through LSD and mushrooms,
- too much reading,
- too much abstraction,
- and a stubborn refusal to give up on either clarity or meaning.

This whole lens grew out of:

- trying to make sense of experience when
  - the old God-map had cracked,
  - the flat materialist map felt too thin,
  - and the mystical map was too myth-heavy to inhabit fully.

What I wanted — and maybe what you want too — was something like:

> a way of seeing that can hold  
> both brutal reality and weird grace,  
> without lying or collapsing.

I don’t know if this book succeeded at that.  
But I know it was written from that place.

If you remember nothing else, maybe let it be three things:

1. **You are always already in a field.**

   - Whatever else is true, there is this happening, now.
   - You can start from here.

2. **The way it’s grouped and storied is not fixed.**

   - Self, world, time, fate — all are compressions.
   - They matter. They’re not arbitrary.
   - And they can also be reworked.

3. **Your pain is not proof of your badness.**
   - It’s information about a configuration.
   - There are moves: stabilising, dissolving, weaving.
   - You don’t have to do them alone.

Thank you for lending your field to this experiment.

Whatever frames you carry forward from here —  
coded, mystical, clinical, artistic, or none at all —

I hope they help you:

- suffer less needlessly,
- love a bit more honestly,
- and recognise yourself, when it matters, as:

> not just a problem to be solved,  
> but a point where the whole field is trying,  
> in its own messy way,  
> to wake up to itself.
