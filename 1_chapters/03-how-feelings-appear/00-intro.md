# How Feelings Appear

In the previous part we stayed (mostly) with shapes:

- the **field** of experience,
- how it’s **structured**,
- how it **clumps** into “things”,
- how **here / body / me** show up,
- how **time / memory / story** hang together,
- how **others** appear in the same field.

We’ve already mentioned feeling here and there, but now we’re going to turn the lights up on it.

Because experience is not just:

- “a room plus a body plus some thoughts plus a timeline.”

It’s also:

- **comfortable or uncomfortable**,
- heavy or light,
- urgent or relaxed,
- hopeful, flat, ashamed, anxious, numb, tender, loving, whatever.

This part is about **how that affective side appears in the same field**.

We’ll look at:

- **raw sensations** – simple bodily feels,
- **emotions** – anger, fear, sadness, joy, etc.,
- **moods** – background weather,
- **valence and pull** – pleasant / unpleasant / neutral; approach / avoid,
- **uncertainty** – not just as an idea, but as a felt texture in the system,
- **intense configurations** – anxiety, shame, anger, numbness,
- **soft / connecting configurations** – love, care, attachment, tenderness.

We’ll also mark an important edge:

- the difference between **physical pain** (signals from the body)
- and the **extra suffering** we build on top of it,
- and what this lens can and can’t realistically help with there.

We’re still not trying to do psychology or neuroscience here.  
We’re still not claiming “what feelings really are”.

We’re doing the same thing we did before:

> Start from what appears,  
> notice how it’s already structured,  
> see how coarse or fine it can show up.

Once we have feelings placed in this map, the next part will make more sense:

- what difficult feelings are **pointing at**,
- how love and attachment stabilise or complicate things,
- and how the system can **reorganise** itself (stabilise / dissolve) in response.

For now, we’ll start with the basics:

> how **sensation, emotion, and mood** show up in the field at all.
