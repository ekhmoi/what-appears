## DRAFT - Physical Pain and Extra Suffering

Before we go further, it’s important to be clear about something this lens **can’t** do.

There is a difference between:

- **pain** – raw-ish physical signals of harm, damage, or strain,
- **extra suffering** – everything the system builds on top of those signals.

This book can’t make broken bones, migraines, chemo, cramps, or nerve pain _not hurt_.  
It would be insulting to imply otherwise.

What it _can_ help with (sometimes) is:

> noticing which parts of your suffering are  
> unavoidable signals from the body,  
> and which parts are added compressions that might be soften-able.

### Pain as appearance in the field

---

When there is physical pain, it appears in the field as:

- specific sensations:
  - burning, stabbing, throbbing, pressure, electric shocks, etc.
- located in certain regions of the body-map,
- changing over time.

You don’t choose it.  
You don’t need a story to have it.  
It just **shows up** as part of the field.

From the system’s perspective, this is:

- crucial information about damage or risk,
- something to be listened to and responded to.

Sometimes that response is:

- rest,
- medication,
- surgery,
- changing how you move,
- getting help.

No amount of subtle phenomenology replaces those.

### The extra layers

---

On top of raw pain, there are often many additional compressions:

- **Identity**

  - “I am a burden”,
  - “I am broken”,
  - “I am useless now.”

- **Time**

  - “It will always be exactly like this”,
  - “The future is nothing but this sensation.”

- **Moral judgement**

  - “I deserve this”,
  - “I should be tougher”,
  - “I’m weak for needing relief.”

- **Comparison**
  - “Other people cope better”,
  - “I shouldn’t complain, others have it worse.”

These are not fake. They are real patterns in the field.  
But they are **optional compressions**, not the pain itself.

They often add:

- shame,
- despair,
- loneliness,

on top of an already hard physical situation.

### What the lens is and isn’t for here

---

This lens **is not** for:

- gritting your teeth through medical emergencies,
- refusing pain relief to “stay with experience”,
- telling other people their pain is “just a story”.

This lens **can sometimes be for**:

- noticing when your system is turning:

  - “this hurts”  
    into
  - “my entire life is nothing but this hurt and it makes me worthless.”

- gently de-clumping:

  - raw sensation,
  - practical limitations,
  - meaning you are making of it,  
    as _different_, even though they’re tangled.

- finding small stabilisations even inside pain:

  - “this really hurts and I can still care about [X]”,
  - “this is awful _today_; I don’t have to solve the whole future right now.”

None of that is magic.  
It doesn’t make a 9/10 pain into 0/10.

But sometimes it can make:

- “9/10 pain + 9/10 self-hatred and doom”

into something more like:

- “9/10 pain + 4/10 extra suffering”.

Which is still hard — just marginally less hellish.

### A note about respecting limits

---

There’s also another side:

Sometimes physical pain and illness **reduce your capacity** to do any of the moves in this book.

You may not have:

- the attention,
- the energy,
- the emotional slack

to stabilise, dissolve, inquire, or anything else.

That’s not a failing.  
That’s just **what this configuration of the field is like**.

In those times, the most honest move might be:

- “I can’t work with this right now. I just need help, rest, meds, sleep.”

This lens is meant to:

- help reduce unnecessary extra suffering **when there is room**,
- not to demand spiritual athleticism from someone already at their limit.
