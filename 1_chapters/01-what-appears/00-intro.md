# Part I Intro: What Appears

In Part 0 I gave you the backstory and the disclaimers.

From here on, we’re going to do something much simpler and much stranger:

We’re going to look at what’s actually showing up in experience.

Not:

- what you’ve been told is “really there”,
- or what your preferred philosophy says exists,
- or what some spiritual book claims is behind appearances.

Just: **what appears.**

Right now, as you’re reading this.

The aim of this part is:

- to give you a felt sense of the **field** – the whole situation of experience at once,
- to notice how that field is already **structured** (near/far, important/unimportant, “me”/“not me”),
- to see how things like **world**, **body**, **self**, **time**, and **story** show up in that field.

We’re not going to explain any of this yet in terms of “how the brain works” or “what reality really is”. There is a time for models. This part is not that time.

Think of it like inspecting a running system before you open the source code.

You don’t need any special skills for this. You don’t need to meditate for ten years. You don’t need to believe anything.

You just need to be willing to:

- pause,
- look at what’s here,
- and describe it a little more carefully than usual.

We’ll start with the simplest thing we can talk about together:

the sense of **“right now, this whole situation I’m in.”**

In the next chapter, we’ll call that the **field** and poke at it from a few angles.
