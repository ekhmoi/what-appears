## Structure: Figure, Background, Near and Far

In the last chapter we called the whole situation of your current experience **the field**.

Now we’ll look at something that’s already happening inside that field, all the time, without you doing anything:

It’s **structured**.

Some parts stand out.  
Some parts fade.  
Some feel close.  
Some feel far.  
Some feel like “me”.  
Some feel like “out there”.

We’re not adding anything new. We’re just noticing patterns that were already there.

---

### Figure and background

---

Pick something you can look at right now. Maybe the screen, a mug, a mark on the wall.

For a moment, let that be the **figure**:

- It’s what attention is on.
- It has more detail.
- It feels more important _for this moment_.

Everything else — the rest of the room, sounds, body sensations — fades into **background**. It doesn’t vanish; it just becomes less vivid.

Now soften your focus and let the whole room be more equal. Then deliberately pick something else as figure: a sound, or the feeling of your feet, or a thought.

You didn’t conjure new objects out of nowhere.  
You just shifted **which part of the field is figure and which is background**.

This is one aspect of **structure**:

> the field is not flat; it has a figure–background organisation that can shift.

Nothing mystical here. It’s the same ordinary thing that lets you read text on a page without being overwhelmed by the rest of your visual field.

### Near and far (without rulers)

---

Now, notice how some things in the field feel **near** and some feel **far**.

This isn’t just about physical distance.

Examples:

- The sound of a car outside might be physically closer than the memory of a fight you had — but the memory might feel “nearer” in terms of emotional impact.
- A notification icon in the corner of your screen is visually tiny, but it might pull more attention than half the room.
- A vague worry about “the future” can feel right up in your face, even though it’s not physically anywhere.

So there are at least two kinds of near/far going on:

- **Spatial-ish** – things look or sound “over there” vs “right here”.
- **Relevance-ish** – things feel “pressing” or “live” vs “somewhere in the background”.

Both are part of how the field is structured.

If you like visual metaphors: it’s like some parts of the field are rendered in high resolution, front-layer, and others are low-res in the back.

### Centre and periphery

---

Most of the time there is a sense of **“here”** — a centre in the field.

That “here” is where:

- sensations of the body cluster,
- perception seems to be “coming from”,
- actions seem to “go out” from.

Even if you accept intellectually that “there is no solid self”, the field still tends to organise around a **hub**:

- _“Here I am, reading.”_
- _“Here I am, walking.”_
- _“Here I am, feeling anxious.”_

There’s nothing wrong or stupid about this. It’s just another piece of structure:

> the field has a **centre** (a here/hub) and a **periphery** (things that are “over there” relative to here).

We’ll come back to this when we talk about body and self. For now, just notice that there is usually some sense of a vantage point, even if it’s subtle.

---

### Inside and outside (as they appear)

---

Another bit of structure that shows up very early in life:

- Some things feel like they are **“in here”**.
- Some things feel like they are **“out there”**.

“In here” usually includes:

- bodily sensations,
- thoughts, images, inner speech,
- emotions, moods.

“Out there” usually includes:

- the room,
- other people,
- objects,
- the past and future as you imagine them “in the world”.

Even if you philosophically believe “it’s all in the brain” or “it’s all one field”, the **appearance** is still split this way.

We’re not deciding which is “true”. We’re just naming the structure:

> There is an **inside/outside** organisation:  
> some parts of the field appear as “me-ish interior”, some as “world-ish exterior”.

Later, when we talk about nondual clarity, we’ll look at how optional this split is. For now, it’s enough to see that it’s there.

### A small pass over your own field

---

A quick exercise. Take half a minute if you can.

1. Look around and pick one visual object as **figure**.
   - Notice what falls into **background** as you do.
2. Shift figure to a **sound**.
   - Notice how the visual field drops back.
3. Shift figure to a **body sensation** (e.g. your hands, your chest).
4. Now, briefly bring to mind something emotionally charged (a person, a worry, a hope).
   - Notice how close or far it feels.
   - Notice whether it feels “in here” or “out there”.

See if you can describe (just to yourself):

- What is figure right now?
- What is background?
- What feels near?
- What feels far?
- Where is “here”?
- What counts as “inside” vs “outside”?

You don’t need perfect answers; this isn’t a test. The point is just to **taste** the structure.

---

### Structure as relational patterning

---

We’ve touched a few recurring patterns:

- figure / background,
- near / far,
- centre / periphery,
- inside / outside.

Together, these are examples of what I mean by **structure**:

> Structure is the relational patterning inside the field:  
> how bits of experience stand in contrast, cluster, and line up relative to each other.

This may sound abstract, but you’ve just _experienced_ it:

- When you moved your attention, figure shifted.
- When you thought of someone important, they came “near” in a non-spatial way.
- When you focused on your chest, “inside” lit up more strongly.

In the next chapter, we’ll look at another aspect of structure:

how the field doesn’t just have loose patterns, but also **“things”** —  
chairs, phones, other people, problems, identities —  
and how those “things” are a kind of **clumping** of detail into usable chunks.
