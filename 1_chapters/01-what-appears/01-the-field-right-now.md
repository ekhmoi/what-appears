## The Field: Right Now, This Whole Situation

Let’s not start with a definition.  
Let’s start with you, sitting (or lying, or standing) where you are.

Before you keep reading, do this:

- Let your eyes land somewhere — on the page, a screen, a wall, whatever.
- Notice that there’s more in view than just the thing you’re focusing on.
- Notice sounds. Obvious ones (voices, traffic, birds) and quiet ones (a fan, your own breath).
- Notice your body: pressure where you’re supported, temperature, any obvious tension or comfort.
- Notice that there are also **thoughts** happening: maybe about this book, maybe about something else entirely.

All of that together — sights, sounds, body sensations, thoughts, moods — is what I’ll call **the field**.

Very simple version:

> The **field** is the whole situation of your experience, right now.

Not “your room” as an object.  
Not “your brain state” as a theory.  
Just: what it’s like to be here at this moment, with all of this showing up.

You don’t have to see it as a mystical thing. It’s the most ordinary thing in the world. You’ve been living inside it the whole time.

### Zooming out a bit

---

When you pay attention like this, you might notice a few things:

- There isn’t just one narrow “object” – there’s a **spread** of impressions.
- Some things are very clear (the text, a sound), others are vague or blurry.
- Some things are obviously “outside” (the room), some feel “inside” (thoughts, emotions, images).
- There is a sense of **“here”** – a kind of centre where all of this is “happening to me”.

We’re not going to analyse any of that yet. Just flagging it:

- “Spread”
- “Inside / outside”
- “Here / centre”

We’ll come back to them.

For now, the main point is: you can relate to your experience as **one field**, not just as separate objects.

---

### A quick check: your field is not my field

---

As you read this, notice:

- Your visual scene is not mine.
- Your body sensations are not mine.
- Your emotional weather right now is not mine.
- Your thoughts about this text are definitely not mine.

Each person has their own field, their own “whole situation”. We can talk _about_ the world, compare notes, build shared models. But the raw **appearing** of things is always **first-person**.

This is important, because later we’ll be talking about:

- how “world” shows up,
- how “other people” show up,
- how “I” shows up.

All of that is happening **in** this personal field.

---

### No special state required

---

You might have a voice that says:

> “I don’t see any ‘field’, I just see my room. Maybe I’m doing this wrong.”

If that comes up, notice that too. That thought is also part of the field.

You don’t have to get into any special, calm, meditative condition. You don’t need to slow your breath, clear your mind, or sit in a particular posture.

All we’re doing is:

- naming the fact that,
- right now,
- a whole lot is showing up at once.

If the word **“field”** annoys you, feel free to mentally swap it with:

- “the whole situation”, or
- “everything that’s going on in my experience right now.”

I’ll keep saying “field” for short.

---

### A tiny exercise

---

Let’s make this less abstract.

Take 30 seconds. (Actually do it if you can.)

1. Look around the space you’re in. Let your gaze wander a bit.
2. Without narrating, just notice: colours, shapes, light, movement.
3. Then close your eyes (or soften your gaze) and notice:
   - sounds,
   - body sensations,
   - any obvious emotional tone (neutral, heavy, restless, light),
   - thoughts drifting through.

Now, in a sentence or two, mentally say:

> “Right now, my field is like: …”

You don’t need poetic language. It can be as simple as:

- “Quiet room, a bit of tension in my neck, low-level worry in the background, reading this, slightly sceptical.”

That sentence is not the field itself. It’s a crude summary. But even doing that once makes the idea more concrete: there _is_ such a thing as the “whole situation” of experience, and you can get a feel for it.

---

### Why this matters later

---

You might reasonably ask: why bother with this? Why not jump straight to “self” or “trauma” or “nonduality”?

Because everything else we’ll talk about:

- world,
- body,
- self,
- time,
- story,
- feelings,
- difficult emotions,

…all show up **inside** this field.

If you only ever look at isolated bits (“my anxiety”, “that person”, “this belief”), it’s easy to miss how they’re sitting in a larger situation.

By getting a feel for **the field as a whole**, we’ll be able to:

- see how some parts of it stand out as important,
- see how some parts become “me” and others “not me”,
- see how time and story get built on top of what’s here.

We’re not going to rush that. Next, we’ll look at how, even inside this one field, some things feel like **figure** and some like **background**, some near and some far.

For now, it’s enough if you can occasionally pause and think:

> “Okay, this — all of this — is my field right now.”

That’s the base layer we’ll keep coming back to.
