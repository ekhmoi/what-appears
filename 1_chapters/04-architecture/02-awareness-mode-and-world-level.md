## Chapter 2 - Awareness-Mode and World-Level

We’ve talked about **field** and **compression** in general.

Now we’ll name two particularly important regimes the system tends to run:

- **awareness-mode**
- **world-level**

You can think of them as:

- two big “operating modes” of the same field,
- each with its own style of compression.

---

### Awareness-mode: the hub that acts and predicts

---

Most of the time, experience is organised around a **hub** that:

- attends,
- chooses,
- predicts,
- updates.

This is what I’ll call **awareness-mode**.

From the inside, it feels like:

- “I am here, aware of this, making sense of it, deciding what to do.”

In terms of architecture, awareness-mode is:

- a way the field structures itself so that:
  - some patterns are treated as “inputs”,
  - some as “internal models”,
  - some as “possible actions”,
  - some as “outcomes”.

It’s not a little homunculus in the head.  
It’s more like a **control loop** woven into the field:

- sensing → modelling → acting → sensing…

When you’re in awareness-mode:

- attention tightens around what seems relevant,
- feeling tones (valence, pull) guide choices,
- past experience is consulted to predict futures.

It’s the mode you’re in when you:

- navigate a conversation,
- debug code,
- decide which way to walk home,
- read this sentence and reflect on it.

---

### World-level: the high-compression “physical world” view

---

On top of awareness-mode, there’s a very fast, very powerful compression:

> **world-level** – treating the field as a world of physical objects, places, and laws.

In world-level:

- you see **things**:

  - cups, doors, phones, cars, streets, clouds.

- you see **spaces**:

  - rooms, cities, skies, interiors and exteriors.

- you see **causal patterns**:
  - “if I push this, it falls”,
  - “if I walk there, I arrive”,
  - “if the sky looks like that, it might rain.”

This is incredibly useful:

- it lets you cross streets without dying,
- design buildings and software,
- coordinate with other people who share similar world-compressions.

World-level is:

- high-compression (it ignores a lot of fine-grained experiential detail),
- extremely stable (most of it doesn’t change moment to moment),
- socially shared (we mostly agree on chairs, doors, weather, etc.).

From inside:

- it gives a strong sense of **“there is a world out there that I’m in”**.

---

### Awareness-mode running world-level

---

Most of ordinary life is:

> awareness-mode **running on** world-level compressions.

In that configuration:

- the **hub** (awareness-mode) sees itself as:

  - located in a body,
  - inside a 3D world,
  - moving through time.

- world-level compressions provide:
  - the objects to act on,
  - the constraints (“you can’t walk through walls”),
  - shared reference points with others.

The architecture is something like:

- field →
- compressions that give “world of objects and laws” →
- awareness-mode hub acting inside that world.

This is so default that it’s hard to even notice it’s a specific mode.

---

### When world-level takes over everything

---

Problems begin when:

- **world-level** is treated as the only real layer,
- other compressions are forced into its shape.

Examples:

- Treating **emotions** as simple “brain chemicals” and ignoring their structural role in the field.
- Treating **self** as either “a soul-stuff” or “just an illusion”, rather than a compression.
- Treating **meaning, value, and relationship** as nothing but “epiphenomena on physical events”.

World-level is excellent at:

- prediction,
- control,
- engineering,
- shared public reality.

It’s not designed for:

- the full richness of **first-person structure**,
- **ethics** and **aesthetics**,
- the felt complexity of **self/other** and **inner life**.

When it colonises everything, you can get:

- flatness,
- alienation,
- a sense that nothing deeply matters because “it’s all just particles / neurons / whatever.”

Part of what this architecture is doing is:

> giving world-level its full importance  
> without letting it pretend to be the whole story.

---

### When awareness-mode stands back from world-level

---

There are also moments where:

- awareness-mode is still running,
- but it loosens its grip on the world-level story.

Examples:

- looking at a scene and suddenly seeing it as pure colour and shape rather than “objects”,
- being deeply in the body without much sense of “room” or “world”,
- meditative or altered states where subject/object framing goes weird.

In those moments, the field is still there, but:

- different compressions are active,
- world-level is de-emphasised or recontextualised.

This can be:

- disorienting,
- relieving,
- or both.

Part IV is partly about giving you a way to understand those modes as:

> different **compression regimes** in the same architecture,  
> not evidence that one side is fake.

In the next chapter, we’ll plug **self, mind, and time** into this picture:

- how they’re built as compressions,
- how they run in awareness-mode,
- how they relate to world-level.
