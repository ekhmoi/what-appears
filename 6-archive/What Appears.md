## **What Appears**

*A phenomenological sketch*

*This is not meant to be a full phenomenology of experience, only a sketch focused on the dimension of articulation/compression across objects, self, time, identity, and affect.*

---

### **0\. What this is (and isn’t)**

This is a **lens** for looking at:

* how experience shows up,  
* how it is already structured,  
* and how that structure can **show up more coarsely or more finely** as:  
  * a world of things,  
  * a “me” in that world,  
  * time, identity, and story.

It tries to stay inside **phenomenology**:

* describing *how* something appears,  
* not claiming *what it really is* beyond appearance.

It is not:

* a theory of what ultimately exists,  
* a claim about physics or neuroscience,  
* or a proof of any metaphysical view.

It’s a way of noticing **what experience is like**, in real time.

---

### **0.1 Tiny glossary (purely experiential)**

Just to keep terms clean:

* **Appearance / experience / the live feed**  
   – whatever is present right now: sights, sounds, body-sense, thoughts, feelings, “world”, “me”, “now”.

* **Field**  
   – shorthand for **the whole current situation as it appears**, taken together: everything in experience at once, in whatever modes. Not something behind appearance; just a name for the *all-at-once* of what’s given.

* **Structure**  
   – patterns, relations, contrasts, groupings inside that field: near/far, figure/ground, pleasant/unpleasant, etc.

* **Differentiation**  
   – how many distinct aspects are noticeable: fine-grained detail vs vague blur.

* **Compression**  
   – the way the field **appears more coarsely or more finely articulated**: a room as “just the room” vs the same scene as many distinct details. This is a description of *how things show up*, not a hidden mechanism.

* **Awareness-mode / hub**  
   – how experience organises around a **centre**: a “here”, a “this body”, a “me” that feels like the vantage point for perception and action, as it appears.

* **World-level**  
   – the familiar way experience shows up as **a relatively stable world of objects in space and time**, with more or less predictable behaviour.

All of these are descriptions of **how things appear**, not of an unseen reality behind them.

---

### **1\. Starting from appearance: the live field**

We begin from the simplest observation:

There is experience. Something is present.

Right now, there may be:

* visual shapes and colours,  
* sounds,  
* body sensations,  
* emotional tone,  
* thoughts about what you’re reading,  
* a sense of “being here”.

Taken together, all of this is the **current field of appearance**:

* one **situation** with many aspects,  
* already there before we analyse it.

We don’t assume anything about what causes it or what lies behind it.  
We just start from: **this is showing up.**

---

### **2\. Looking closer: differentiation and structure**

If you gently pay attention to any simple moment – say sitting in a room – a few things can be noticed:

* Experience is not one uniform blob.  
* It is **differentiated**:  
  * bright vs dim,  
  * near vs far,  
  * sharp vs vague,  
  * pleasant vs unpleasant,  
  * “here” vs “over there”.

There are also **relations**:

* one thing overlaps another,  
* one sound masks another,  
* one sensation feels “inside”, another “outside”,  
* one thought responds to another.

We can call this relational patterning **structure**:

Experience is structured: it shows up as **many**, in various relations, not as featureless “stuff”.

If attention opens more, each “thing” can **fracture into more detail**:

* a “table” can appear as:  
  * colours, edges, reflections, tactile expectations, small irregularities.  
* “my body” can appear as:  
  * pressure, warmth, tingling, tension, posture, internal movements, and an image of the body.

So, even before we talk about “world” or “self”, the field already has:

* **variety** (many distinguishable bits),  
* **organisation** (ways those bits hang together).

---

### **3\. Compression: how coarse or fine things show up**

In practice, not every tiny distinction is equally foregrounded.

Instead, what shows up can *feel* more or less:

* **chunked** vs detailed,  
* **solid** vs sketch-like,  
* **fixed** vs open.

This is what we’re calling:

**Compression**  
 \= a way the field **shows up as more coarsely or more finely articulated**.

Nothing here assumes an underlying computational process; ‘compression’ is just a nickname for how coarse or fine, tight or loose, the articulation of the field *appears from here*.”

You can notice this directly:

* Sometimes “the room” is just **“room”** – one vague chunk.  
* Sometimes the same situation shows up as:  
  * wall, desk, plant, light reflection, tiny scratch, dust on the surface.

From the side of appearance, what is given is simply:

* the **current articulation** – more coarse or more fine,  
* plus the possibility of that articulation **loosening** into more detail or **tightening** into simpler chunks.

“Compression” here is just a label for:

* this difference in **granularity**,  
* and for the *felt sense of grip* or *insistence* that certain ways of grouping and holding things together have.

It does not posit an extra process we cannot experience; it points to what can be noticed about **how strongly things hang together** and **how much detail is in view**.

---

### **4\. Object compression: from flux to “things in a world”**

One familiar kind of compression shows up as **objects**.

Example: a tree.

Across many moments, there may be:

* shifting light and shadow,  
* moving leaves,  
* changing backgrounds,  
* different angles and distances,  
* different emotional associations.

Yet it can show up simply as:

“that tree” – one object.

In experience, “this tree” appears as:

* a **coarse pattern** that hangs together across change:  
  * many visual details,  
  * tactile expectations,  
  * memories,  
  * uses (“shade”, “beauty”, “climbable”),  
* and is taken *as* one unit across moments.

The same holds for:

* “phone”, “chair”, “sky”, “hand”, “message”, etc.

So what appears as a **world of solid things** is:

* a way the field is **grouped and stabilised**,  
* with labels and expectations helping certain patterns stand out as “the same thing” across change.

From inside experience, this style of grouping is **often feels as if ‘what to do’ is obvious**:

* things can be grasped, avoided, used, navigated.

That is a description of how it **feels and functions**, not a claim that this way of grouping exists “for” some deeper purpose.

Object compression is not described here as an error.  
 It’s one of the familiar ways the field appears.

---

### **5\. Hub compression: “here”, “this body”, “me”**

Alongside objects, there is usually a sense of:

* **here** vs **there**,  
* **this body** vs other bodies,  
* **me** vs “not-me”.

This can be described as:

**Hub compression (awareness-mode)**  
 \= the way experience appears as centred on a **vantage point**.

Phenomenologically, the hub shows up as:

* a cluster of sensations:  
  * posture, breath, heartbeat, internal movements,  
  * contact with surfaces (chair, floor, clothes),  
* along with:  
  * a sense of owning or inhabiting them (“this is my body”),  
  * and a sense that perception and action are “from here”.

From within experience, this centre feels like:

* where actions start (“I reach”, “I speak”),  
* where impacts land (“it hurts *me*”),  
* where attention “lives”.

We don’t need to say what the hub “really is” physically.  
 We’re just naming a **pattern in the field**:

many bodily and situational cues appear together as a **single centre**:  
 “here”, “this body”, “me”.

Later, more elaborate self-descriptions (“I’m shy”, “I’m competent”) can build on this; the simple hub and the narrative self are related but not the same.

---

### **6\. Time compression: from countless micro-changes to “before / now / after”**

Experience is constantly changing:

* micro-shifts in sensation,  
* thoughts arising and passing,  
* moods tilting,  
* subtle bodily adjustments.

Yet this does not appear as sheer chaos. It shows up as:

* a **sense of flow** – “time is passing”,  
* a **sense of order** – “first that, then this”,  
* a **sense of duration** – “this felt long/short”.

Within experience, periods can be *taken as*:

* “this moment right now”,  
* “the whole morning”,  
* “that talk”,  
* “my childhood”.

In this lens, time is described as:

the way change is **given as ordered and chunked** in experience:  
 “before / now / after”,  
 “this phase / that phase”.

This is not a claim about what time *is* beyond appearance.  
 It’s a description of how **change is organised as it appears**.

---

### **7\. Concept, identity, and narrative: meaning, roles, story**

On top of objects, hub, and time, further articulations show up.

#### **7.1 Conceptual grouping**

Repeated patterns get:

* named,  
* and packaged with expectations.

For example:

* after many encounters, various different people and situations are all taken under one heading:  
  * “friend”, “enemy”, “partner”, “authority”, “threat”, “safe”.

Each concept:

* gathers many experiences into one **handle**,  
* brings along predictions and tendencies:  
  * “friends do X, enemies do Y”,  
  * “this kind of place is dangerous”, etc.

These groupings are not only individual.  
 They are also **socially shaped**:

* language,  
* shared norms,  
* other people’s reactions,

all show up inside the field and participate in how situations are read:

* what counts as “friend”, “failure”, “success”, “normal”, “abnormal”, etc.,  
* in how situations feel and are interpreted from here.

#### **7.2 Identity compression (narrative self)**

Experiences involving “this hub” get woven into **self-descriptions**.

For example:

* “I was quiet there”, “I avoided that argument”, “I felt bad at that party”  
   → may be held together as:  
   “I’m shy” or “I’m socially awkward”.

This identity then:

* filters new experiences,  
* shapes expectations of what “I” will do,  
* and becomes a **relatively stable pattern** in the field.

Here it’s useful to distinguish:

* the **immediate hub** (“this body / this vantage”),  
* and the **narrative self** (“the kind of person I am”).

Both are compressions in this sense, but at different levels.

#### **7.3 Narrative compression**

Events across time get stitched into **stories**:

* “my life”,  
* “this relationship”,  
* “my trauma”,  
* “my spiritual journey”.

Narratives do a lot of compression:

* countless concrete moments → one **coherent line**.

Contradictions and outliers often:

* fade into the background,  
* get explained away,  
* or are bent to fit the story.

From inside, story often feels like:

* meaning,  
* direction,  
* identity over time.

All of this is still a description of **how experience organises itself**, not a claim about what truly exists “out there” or “in here”.

---

### **8\. Horizon and absence: what’s “there” without being fully given**

Often, what is “here” includes aspects that are **not fully present** but:

* implied,  
* anticipated,  
* or co-intended.

Examples:

* the unseen back of the tree that is still “there”,  
* the next seconds of a melody you “know” are coming,  
* the reaction you expect from a friend,  
* tomorrow’s meeting that colours how today feels.

These are not vividly given in the same way as the current visual field or bodily sensations, yet they belong to the **same experiential situation**.

In this lens, compression also includes how the field gathers **present and implied aspects** into coherent patterns:

* “this same tree”,  
* “this same person”,  
* “this ongoing situation”,

even when much of that is only **suggested** rather than clearly perceived.

Again, this is a description of how things appear — including what is *horizontally* present as possibility or expectation — not a claim about hidden entities.

---

### **9\. Feeling: how the fit of current organisation is sensed**

Now to feeling / affect.

In this lens, feeling can be *described* as:

the **felt quality** of how the current organisation of experience is going from here.

Some rough patterns:

* When the current groupings **fit enough**:  
  * the world feels understandable enough,  
  * self-story roughly matches events,  
  * time-story holds together.  
* → there can be ease, flow, or at least a sense of “workable”.

* When the current groupings **don’t fit**:  
  * expected patterns break,  
  * identities are challenged,  
  * stories no longer make sense,  
  * too much is ungrouped or contradictory.  
* → there can be:  
  * anxiety, confusion, shame, anger, numbness, overwhelm.

Examples (as one way of reading the feel):

* **Anxiety** can feel like:  
   “Too many possibilities / too much uncertainty; the ways I’m holding things don’t yield a safe or clear next move from here.”

* **Shame** can feel like:  
   “The way I see myself and the way this situation seems to ‘read’ me don’t match; something about ‘me’ feels exposed and wrong.”

* **Relief** can feel like:  
   “A simpler, better-fitting pattern has landed; the tension between what’s here and how I hold it has eased.”

This is **not** offered as a reduction of emotion to “fit signals” or a full theory of emotion.  
 It’s one way of noticing that:

feeling often shows up as an **immediate, embodied sense** of how well the current ways of grouping and interpreting feels workable/unworkable from here..

Other descriptions of emotion are compatible with this; this is just one phenomenological angle.

---

### **10\. Attention, intention, and changes in compression**

Changes in compression can seem to:

* happen apparently on their own,  
* or **come with shifts in attention and intention**.

Phenomenologically, attention and intention themselves show up as:

* a tilt of the field toward some aspects and away from others,  
* a felt “leaning” into certain details or certain readings.

For example:

* deliberately “looking more closely” at the room:  
  * more differentiation appears; more micro-structure becomes salient.  
* deliberately “just seeing it as a blur of traffic”:  
  * many differences recede; a coarse pattern comes forward.

In this lens, we *don’t need to treat* these as operations of a hidden inner agent; we can just describe them as ways the field appears to reorganise:

- different emphases,  
- different granularity,  
- different grips.

Agency talk (“I chose to look closer”) can itself be treated as part of the narrative self; here we’re just pointing to the *experienced* shifts in focus and articulation.

---

### **11\. When compressions loosen: more field, less story**

Sometimes, whether through practice, intense events, altered states, or just randomly, the usual compressions **loosen** a bit.

Phenomenologically, that can look like:

* objects appearing less solid and more like shifting patterns,  
* the sense of “me here vs world there” softening,  
* the time-story (“this is my life moving forward”) getting quieter,  
* a simple, vivid presence of colours, sounds, body, space, without so much labelling.

Functioning may continue, but:

* the **grip** of concepts, identities, and narratives is lighter,  
* experience feels more **open, immediate, and continuous**.

You can describe this as:

a shift into a mode where experience is **less tightly compressed**, more **finely differentiated**,  
 with less insistence on “solid self”, “solid world”, and “solid time”.

This does not require claiming:

* “the self is unreal”,  
* “the world is an illusion”,  
* or “all is one in an ultimate sense”.

It just reports:

* a recognizable change in **how experience is articulated**,  
* and how that change feels from “here”.

---

### **12\. When subject / object soften: a non-dual-ish reading**

In some of these looser states, a specific change can be noticed:

* the split between “subject in here” and “objects out there” becomes less absolute.

Phenomenologically:

* perception still happens: shapes, sounds, body-sense, thoughts.  
* the hub (this body, this vantage) is still present.  
* but the sense that there are **two fundamentally separate sides**:  
  * “me who has experience”  
     vs  
  * “world that is experienced”

may ease.

Instead, it can feel more like:

* **one continuous field** with:  
  * near aspects (body, thoughts, emotions),  
  * far aspects (tree, sky, other people),

without a hard wall between “inner” and “outer”.

From this lens, that can be described simply as:

a change in **how the field is organised as it appears**:  
 the subject/object distinction is seen as one **way of organising appearance**,  
 not as an unquestionable division written into experience.

These looser modes are still just **ways things can show up**, not privileged revelations of an ultimate reality.

---

### **13\. Very short recap (phenomenology only)**

* We start from **appearance** – whatever is present.  
* This appearance is already **structured** and **differentiated**.  
* For convenience, we call the whole current situation the **field**.  
* Within the field, what shows up can be:  
  * more **finely differentiated** or more **coarsely chunked**,  
  * more **loosely** or more **tightly gripped**.  
* We call these differences **compressions**:  
  * grouping detail into **objects**,  
  * centring on a **hub / “me here”**,  
  * letting change be given as **time**,  
  * gathering many events into **concepts, identities, stories**,  
  * including horizons of what is implied or expected but not fully given.  
* These compressions describe how experience **shows up as manageable and patterned**, and they also **leave out or distort** detail.  
* **Feeling** can be one way the current match or mismatch between what’s happening and these compressions is sensed from here.  
* At times, compressions can **loosen**:  
  * more of the field is felt directly,  
  * the subject/object split softens,  
  * the same life is read with less rigid self/world/time story.

No claim here about what exists beyond experience.  
Just a way of looking at:

**how experience shows up as “world, self, time, and feeling” by presenting a live field of appearance that can be held more tightly or loosely, more coarsely or finely articulated.**
